08/10/2014, 5:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
08/10/2014, 5:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Sorry, I was confused by the +47 number
08/10/2014, 5:40 pm - Stephen Browett: So you're back in the UK now or is this just a new phone?
08/10/2014, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Pffft
08/10/2014, 5:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's my Norwegian number hence the +47
08/10/2014, 5:48 pm - Stephen Browett: But I know a few people with Norwegian numbers now
08/10/2014, 5:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Bring Mr popular and all :p
08/10/2014, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Being *
08/10/2014, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: You're clearly the best Norwegian though :)
08/10/2014, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: You being a cool kid and all üòé
08/10/2014, 7:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha thanks
08/10/2014, 7:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Saving yourself there
08/10/2014, 7:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Guess what
08/10/2014, 7:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have a new work phone
08/10/2014, 7:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Only reason why I can use whatsapp
08/10/2014, 7:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Ooh!
08/10/2014, 7:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Is it an iPhone by chance?
08/10/2014, 7:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: It is
08/10/2014, 7:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: How'd you know?
08/10/2014, 7:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Everyone knows and it freaks me out
08/10/2014, 7:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Am I giving you some information?
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Stephen Browett: No lol educated guess my dear Watson
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Stephen Browett: And you better know what that is a reference to :p
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: I do
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sherlock Holmes
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Most company phones are iPhones and most Norwegians own iPhones
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: True
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Stephen Browett: ÓÄé
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm so not a fan though
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Top of the class!
08/10/2014, 7:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Prefer Samsung
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Me neither
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh well
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Stephen Browett: You seen the videos of the iPhone 6 plus bending?
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Seems a bit cheap to me
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's a free iPhone and paid for so it's all good
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: No?
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Stephen Browett: True lol can't complain
08/10/2014, 7:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Only heard bad things about iPhone 6
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll send you a YouTube link in a minute about it
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: Cool
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: How are you anyway?
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Stephen Browett: Apparently they've been bending just because they've been in the pockets of skinny jeans
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haven't spoken with you in a while
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm cool thanks :)
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ohhhh
08/10/2014, 7:43 pm - Stephen Browett: I know right, apart from snapchat faces lol
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: I did hear about that!!
08/10/2014, 7:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: That's rubbish
08/10/2014, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Who wants a phone like that
08/10/2014, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha
08/10/2014, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: True
08/10/2014, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Me insulting you
08/10/2014, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòá
08/10/2014, 7:45 pm - Stephen Browett: Pfft, with friends like that
08/10/2014, 7:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: It works because we're friends üòä
08/10/2014, 7:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: I hope...
08/10/2014, 7:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Not now! How dare you!
08/10/2014, 7:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Óêâ
08/10/2014, 7:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: But... Friends üòï
08/10/2014, 7:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Have you been working any more at the playground?
08/10/2014, 7:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I feel like I've been wronged and you need to make it up to me
08/10/2014, 7:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Naa that was just a one time thing
08/10/2014, 7:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Though I might go back next week to help out
08/10/2014, 7:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh yeah? How so?
08/10/2014, 7:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah I see
08/10/2014, 7:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm on job seekers allowance now :)
08/10/2014, 7:50 pm - Stephen Browett: I've officially qualified as a bum haha
08/10/2014, 7:50 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't know how you can make it up to me, you have to figure it out, buddy :p
08/10/2014, 7:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: You're not a bum and I think it's  good you can get some help on the income now
08/10/2014, 7:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Weeeeell I thought we already were friends and don't see how I could be any more awesome towards you üòé
08/10/2014, 8:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha clearly a good point
08/10/2014, 8:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Don't worry about it, I'll be the bigger person here and forgive you :p
08/10/2014, 8:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: You just paid back!!!
08/10/2014, 8:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: That's not being the bigger person
08/10/2014, 8:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Two conversations, doesn't count :p
08/10/2014, 8:23 pm - Stephen Browett: In these rules I just made up
08/10/2014, 8:24 pm - Stephen Browett: :)
08/10/2014, 8:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Made up rules do not apply
08/10/2014, 8:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòí
08/10/2014, 8:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Anywho
08/10/2014, 8:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: What are you up to?
08/10/2014, 8:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: I actually speak english almost constantly at work still
08/10/2014, 8:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: So confused between the languages
08/10/2014, 8:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not sure if I know how to keep them separate anymore
08/10/2014, 8:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you had a dream in English yet?
08/10/2014, 8:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Think so yeah
08/10/2014, 8:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Is this what you mean by you can't keep the languages apart?
08/10/2014, 8:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: Nah
08/10/2014, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's  my brain being confused so I never know what will come out of my mouth haha
08/10/2014, 8:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: It can be a good combination because  I automatically think in English but if I hear Norwegian I switch to that and then it gets mixed
08/10/2014, 8:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Especially  when I have people with both languages around
08/10/2014, 8:55 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm not surprised that's confusing
08/10/2014, 8:55 pm - Stephen Browett: My mom started talking to me in Polish the other day and I had to tell her because she hasn't noticed
08/10/2014, 8:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Does she know polish?
08/10/2014, 8:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, she's been taking lessons for about 3 years now
08/10/2014, 8:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Because there are some polish kids at school and no one else speaks it
08/10/2014, 8:57 pm - Stephen Browett: So my mom has a job teaching polish kids English lol
08/10/2014, 8:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah that's good of her
08/10/2014, 9:05 pm - Stephen Browett: It means mom is guaranteed a job as long there are polish kids
08/10/2014, 9:05 pm - Stephen Browett: And tbh there's more every year
08/10/2014, 9:05 pm - Stephen Browett: She's got 5 or 6 now
08/10/2014, 9:05 pm - Stephen Browett: But anyway, that's boring
08/10/2014, 9:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Hows your new job going?
08/10/2014, 9:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's going well :) I really like it
08/10/2014, 9:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Been in the lab the past couple of days so get to do some more practical work before running tests and creating analyses
08/10/2014, 9:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: So I'm part of a project where we have a satellite which should get another satellite to Mercury so it can orbit it and gather data
08/10/2014, 9:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: So my understanding is that we create the main mechanism which drives both satellites to Mercury
08/10/2014, 9:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: So could be interesting to see the final result
08/10/2014, 10:06 pm - Stephen Browett: As in the guiding software or the physical propellant to send it there?
08/10/2014, 10:06 pm - Stephen Browett: It sounds amazing!
08/10/2014, 10:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Can't wait for you to get me a job there as well :p
08/10/2014, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's not a propellant but the motor which drives the solar arrays that generate energy to get there
08/10/2014, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: If that makes sense
08/10/2014, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: That's what they're delivering for this project anyway
08/10/2014, 10:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Bedtime for me now
08/10/2014, 10:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Night night
08/10/2014, 10:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Ah I see, sounds really cool though!
08/10/2014, 10:18 pm - Stephen Browett: And goodnight :)
08/10/2014, 10:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Have fun in the labs tomorrow! Haha
10/10/2014, 3:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: üí©üôà
10/10/2014, 7:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Is that what happened at work today? :p
10/10/2014, 7:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Did you have an 'accident'
10/10/2014, 7:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
10/10/2014, 7:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: I had a poo?
10/10/2014, 7:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Noo hahaha
10/10/2014, 7:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Sounds suspicious to me!
10/10/2014, 7:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: And why is that?
10/10/2014, 7:53 pm - Stephen Browett: I like how I didn't even have to look at who sent the messages one I saw what it was :p
10/10/2014, 7:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: If you want to know my toilet habits I'm happy to share them with you
10/10/2014, 7:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Your denial is suspicious
10/10/2014, 7:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes please :)
10/10/2014, 7:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÄ
10/10/2014, 7:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok, so I always go to the toilet in the morning to pee
10/10/2014, 7:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: And the same before bed
10/10/2014, 7:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Then it depends on how much I drink and what people are around whether or not I pee at work
10/10/2014, 7:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Theeeeeen anything else I always do at home once a day when I feel the need for it :)
10/10/2014, 7:57 pm - Stephen Browett: This was very insightful, thank you
10/10/2014, 7:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Want to compare toilet journals?
10/10/2014, 7:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not really
10/10/2014, 7:57 pm - Stephen Browett: I make a record of every time I go
10/10/2014, 7:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÑ
10/10/2014, 7:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha you write it down?
10/10/2014, 7:58 pm - Stephen Browett: With a picture, yes
10/10/2014, 7:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: I see
10/10/2014, 7:59 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm definitely messing with you right now :p
10/10/2014, 7:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don't want to see that haha
10/10/2014, 8:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha if you're sure :p
10/10/2014, 8:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh I definitely am ;) haha
10/10/2014, 8:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Did i tell you a professor at Southampton uni is interested in me doing a PhD for him?
10/10/2014, 8:58 pm - Stephen Browett: On a slight change of subject lol
10/10/2014, 8:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: No?? What a funny coincidence! I just looked at PhDs there!!
10/10/2014, 8:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: What in and when?? :D
10/10/2014, 8:59 pm - Stephen Browett: No way! That would be awesome lol
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: It's in magnetospheric observations
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: That's really cool :)
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: I hope you get it
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't know any more than that as it's still early days but we've been chatting by email and he seems like a really nice guy
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Me too lol
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: What have you been looking at then?
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: I guess that will be next year then?
10/10/2014, 9:01 pm - Stephen Browett: This is an awesome coincidence lol
10/10/2014, 9:01 pm - Stephen Browett: This April I think
10/10/2014, 9:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha anything and everything
10/10/2014, 9:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: I won't go for another two years though
10/10/2014, 9:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: :/
10/10/2014, 9:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm just looking to see what's available
10/10/2014, 9:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Is that because of this job you've got now?
10/10/2014, 9:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah
10/10/2014, 9:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Well still be there at the same time though by the sounds of it
10/10/2014, 9:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Small overlap at least
10/10/2014, 9:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yeah
10/10/2014, 9:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's a good uni :)
10/10/2014, 10:23 pm - Stephen Browett: As an even further coincidence, is the same place my cousin got his PhD lol
10/10/2014, 10:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Small world eh?
10/10/2014, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha it is yeah
17/10/2014, 4:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Now eat those sticks
17/10/2014, 11:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Nei!
17/10/2014, 11:13 pm - Stephen Browett: They're all thorny
17/10/2014, 11:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Won't be tasty lol
18/10/2014, 1:04 am - Solveig Andvig: :(
18/10/2014, 1:04 am - Solveig Andvig: I thought it was a great idea
18/10/2014, 1:21 am - Stephen Browett: I'll save you some if you like?
18/10/2014, 1:21 am - Stephen Browett: :)
18/10/2014, 1:21 am - Stephen Browett: I'm happy to share
18/10/2014, 8:15 am - Solveig Andvig: Sure :)
18/10/2014, 3:26 pm - Stephen Browett: No worries
18/10/2014, 3:26 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm not sure how weird this is lol
18/10/2014, 3:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: What do you mean?
18/10/2014, 6:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Eating sticks
18/10/2014, 6:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Still, it's not the strangest thing we've talked about haha
18/10/2014, 9:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: True :)
18/10/2014, 9:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sorry for the late reply
18/10/2014, 9:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: My phone doesn't notify me when I get messages so have to check manually
19/10/2014, 2:40 am - Stephen Browett: No worries, I figured you had a life :p
19/10/2014, 2:41 am - Stephen Browett: If you do, you must tell me what that's like?
19/10/2014, 2:41 am - Stephen Browett: Haha
19/10/2014, 2:42 am - Stephen Browett: Is this your new iPhone?
19/10/2014, 2:43 am - Stephen Browett: Clearly you need to get on this Sony xperia hype next :p
19/10/2014, 4:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: I switched it off manually because I couldn't work out how to put my phone on silent and I don't want notifications throughout the day when I'm around coworkers or in meetings :)
19/10/2014, 4:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: I do have a life now and it's slightly stressful too but in a different and more satisfying way üëå
19/10/2014, 4:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: I actually get to spend my evenings and weekends doing what I want to do
19/10/2014, 8:31 pm - Stephen Browett: That's really nice :)
19/10/2014, 8:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Though by the look of your face on snapchat all you want to do is sleep :p
19/10/2014, 8:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: That is true
19/10/2014, 8:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Is it your work that's stressful in a satisfying way?
19/10/2014, 8:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: Noo the work at home haha
19/10/2014, 8:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: Work is good
19/10/2014, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm watching a TV show so waiting for that to finish before going to bed
19/10/2014, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: How was it to see James?
19/10/2014, 8:34 pm - Stephen Browett: What work at home have you been doing?
19/10/2014, 8:34 pm - Stephen Browett: It was awesome to see James again
19/10/2014, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Err, various things at the farm and I'm painting my room which takes time
19/10/2014, 8:35 pm - Stephen Browett: We were both saying that we don't have any mates at home that we can talk about physics with so it was nice to get our nerd on for a bit :p
19/10/2014, 8:35 pm - Stephen Browett: That's cool
19/10/2014, 8:36 pm - Stephen Browett: You not finished painting your room yet? :p
19/10/2014, 8:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah yes, I miss that too!
19/10/2014, 8:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: No I've finished grounding it so it's all white instead of bright yellow and green
19/10/2014, 8:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Needed two layers
19/10/2014, 8:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: And we have panels so need two different brushes and lists at the top and bottom which also need painting
19/10/2014, 8:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: And the doors are a nightmare to paint
19/10/2014, 8:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
19/10/2014, 8:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: So yeah it takes time! Especially since I only get 2 h every evening and the weekends but still lots of other things to do
19/10/2014, 8:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: How's the phd and job search going?
21/10/2014, 3:46 pm - Stephen Browett: I forgot that your house has wooden panels
21/10/2014, 3:46 pm - Stephen Browett: I understand now haha
21/10/2014, 3:46 pm - Stephen Browett: And I'm in the job centre atm so the job hunt isn't going amazingly lol
21/10/2014, 3:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah :(
21/10/2014, 3:47 pm - Stephen Browett: But I have had a couple of telephone interviews so fingers crossed!
21/10/2014, 3:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes :) you might just have to come back to Norway haha
21/10/2014, 3:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: You could probably find work in the space department where I'm working
21/10/2014, 3:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Maybe
21/10/2014, 3:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: They wanted me at least!
21/10/2014, 4:15 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha you've got all your experience though!
21/10/2014, 4:15 pm - Stephen Browett: But I do have my push English accent to impress foreigners :p
21/10/2014, 4:16 pm - Stephen Browett: But don't tempt me because I will have a look now
21/10/2014, 4:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Speaking Norwegian would be an issue though

21/10/2014, 4:18 pm - Stephen Browett: You can't keep me away!
21/10/2014, 4:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Why does that sound like a threat?
21/10/2014, 4:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha

21/10/2014, 6:14 pm - Stephen Browett: I must be a bit of a stalker then...
21/10/2014, 6:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Well it's a good job I've accepted it then :p
21/10/2014, 6:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: The summer program looks better on the CV than what it was in reality
23/10/2014, 1:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Omg!! I got distinction for my master thesis! :D
23/10/2014, 7:26 pm - Stephen Browett: No way!
23/10/2014, 7:27 pm - Stephen Browett: And to think you weren't sure about what grade you were going to get :p
23/10/2014, 7:27 pm - Stephen Browett: You absolute genius
23/10/2014, 7:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
23/10/2014, 8:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: I am shocked! Never had I expected that I would get that
23/10/2014, 8:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: It really wasn't my best work
23/10/2014, 8:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: But doesn't matter now, I'm happy :D

26/10/2014, 10:29 pm - Stephen Browett: I just saw the pictures and they look amazing!
26/10/2014, 10:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I was really tempted to make a joke about all the viking stuff being all in use in Norway :p
26/10/2014, 10:30 pm - Stephen Browett: But I didn't so it's OK lol
27/10/2014, 5:41 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha I'll let her know that you're wishing her happy birthday!
27/10/2014, 5:41 am - Solveig Andvig: I had that pay thing as well and got so fed up with it that I stopped using whatsapp
27/10/2014, 5:42 am - Solveig Andvig: Works fine to ignore it though, they are desperate to keep you there to use it so they give you new chances to try it for another month EVERY month
27/10/2014, 10:52 am - Stephen Browett: Woot!
27/10/2014, 10:52 am - Stephen Browett: Cheers to being cheap :p
27/10/2014, 10:53 am - Stephen Browett: Óåå

27/10/2014, 2:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah
27/10/2014, 2:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's why I started using hangouts because they didn't ask me to upgrade every month
27/10/2014, 4:25 pm - Stephen Browett: You've got some sense then
27/10/2014, 4:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Was your weekend nice?
27/10/2014, 4:26 pm - Stephen Browett: And you're over here now aren't you?

27/10/2014, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: You need to sack off work and come over to the more awesome country :p
27/10/2014, 5:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: He was in Oslo with me :) and I will come to the UK soon, but I think you agree that Norway is the better country out of the two places
27/10/2014, 5:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is Devon nice now? :) is it with your family?
27/10/2014, 9:03 pm - Stephen Browett: It's my favourite type of weather atm so I'm loving it :p
27/10/2014, 9:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Slightly chilly and cloudy and wet on the ground

29/10/2014, 6:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is that a compliment? Haha
29/10/2014, 6:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hope you guys enjoy yourself :)
29/10/2014, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Aye, the holiday is nice
29/10/2014, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: I think that was a compliment
29/10/2014, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Or an insult
29/10/2014, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: I can't tell what's sarcasm any more :p

04/01/2015, 1:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm sure you'll be fine! And a one person flat was a good choice
04/01/2015, 1:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Better to be your own boss of the house
04/01/2015, 4:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh yes lol
04/01/2015, 4:19 pm - Stephen Browett: But I'm the boss of wherever I live üòä

28/06/2015, 9:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòê

29/06/2015, 8:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oil business is going shit so the after effects will soon be visible to the general public
29/06/2015, 11:04 pm - Stephen Browett: I assume the drop in oil prices is good for you individually?
29/06/2015, 11:05 pm - Stephen Browett: That's so exciting! You living on your own or with people? And where are you looking?
30/06/2015, 5:22 am - Solveig Andvig: Well I wouldn't say good in that sense, it affects us all one way or another because we rely on it so much
30/06/2015, 5:22 am - Solveig Andvig: But it's mostly people losing their jobs now and that's where most of the money has been
30/06/2015, 5:22 am - Solveig Andvig: So houses might get cheaper because the economy is also getting worse
30/06/2015, 5:22 am - Solveig Andvig: Looking at staying in Kongsberg within walking or cycling distance to work!
30/06/2015, 5:23 am - Solveig Andvig: And I'm going to find my own place - sick and tired of living with people :p haha

02/07/2015, 12:47 am - Stephen Browett: Please beat David at everything
02/07/2015, 12:48 am - Stephen Browett: That will drive him insane lol
02/07/2015, 5:11 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha :p I'll get it if I have time to use it but atm it seems a bit pointless
02/07/2015, 5:12 am - Solveig Andvig: And I don't think I'll ever have a chance to beat him
02/07/2015, 9:43 pm - Stephen Browett: No worries, I struggle to at the best of times
02/07/2015, 9:44 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll have some competition though lol

11/08/2015, 6:58 am - Solveig Andvig: And then I asked if you were away on holiday now but judging from the beach selfie I think you are! Hahah
11/08/2015, 11:07 am - Stephen Browett: You'd be right!
11/08/2015, 11:07 am - Stephen Browett: Haha that's why messages are a bit sporadic
11/08/2015, 11:07 am - Stephen Browett: I don't get signal at the place we're staying

11/08/2015, 10:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Excellent weather to make you feel like you're battling the elements lol
11/08/2015, 10:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes, we have it the opposite way around
12/08/2015, 12:55 am - Stephen Browett: I miss Norway, I want to go kayaking in the fjords
12/08/2015, 12:55 am - Stephen Browett: Take me on an adventure holiday!
12/08/2015, 12:56 am - Stephen Browett: That's definitely me asking really nicely, not getting carried away with myself

12/08/2015, 12:57 am - Stephen Browett: General adventuring /outdoor activities
12/08/2015, 5:16 am - Solveig Andvig: Not much no
12/08/2015, 5:16 am - Solveig Andvig: Not enough to take tou with me without doing research
12/08/2015, 5:44 am - Solveig Andvig: We did some in school but there everything was already prepared :-) lise lotte does a lot of it though, she's very experienced so I can always talk with her

17/08/2015, 5:35 pm - Stephen Browett: You'll be waiting a little while lol
17/08/2015, 5:35 pm - Stephen Browett: I've got my 9 month report to get on with and a talk I have to give in Venice
17/08/2015, 5:35 pm - Stephen Browett: So it's been pushed back a little bit
17/08/2015, 5:36 pm - Stephen Browett: But it is just a case of collecting figures I want to put in it and get writing lol
17/08/2015, 5:36 pm - Stephen Browett: I just want to get it done already!
17/08/2015, 5:36 pm - Stephen Browett: You're a bit keen to read it though?
17/08/2015, 5:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha! Wow busy man
17/08/2015, 5:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Of course!
17/08/2015, 5:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Makes me self conscious
17/08/2015, 5:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Exciting when people I know are going to publish articles üòÑ
17/08/2015, 5:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Nah don't be, I've forgotten most of it so it will be impressive and interesting
17/08/2015, 5:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha thanks, buddy :p
17/08/2015, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I enjoy the science but the paper writing seems like a bit of a chore
17/08/2015, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: How's things your end? People still being mean?
17/08/2015, 5:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's a bit better, we'll see by Friday if I'm crying again! (Not really but you know what I mean)
17/08/2015, 5:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm writing about markets and I have no clue what I'm doing
17/08/2015, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's like writing your first university homework and you don't know what the lecturer is expecting and you completely fuck up so he/she thinks you don't know what's going on at all
17/08/2015, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Which could be true
17/08/2015, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: But at least you tried
17/08/2015, 5:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha you always say that but your homework was always amazing!
17/08/2015, 5:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha not here!
17/08/2015, 5:52 pm - Stephen Browett: I should know, I copied it often enough haha
17/08/2015, 5:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha I believe we cooperates
17/08/2015, 5:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'd never let you copy just straight off without putting some effort into it ;)
17/08/2015, 6:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'm glad you believe that :p
17/08/2015, 6:06 pm - Stephen Browett: But the point is that your work is always top notch
17/08/2015, 6:06 pm - Stephen Browett: I believe in you!
17/08/2015, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Pfff
17/08/2015, 6:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Plus markets are dumb
17/08/2015, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm on thin ice here hahaha
17/08/2015, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well they are interesting but I really have no clue of what I'm talking about!
17/08/2015, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: I got some input from the market guy and he is very nice but busy guy
19/08/2015, 1:31 am - Stephen Browett: That's understandable, hopefully he at least have you a clue as to the direction to go in? And things you should talk about?
19/08/2015, 1:31 am - Stephen Browett: Why are you on thin ice?
19/08/2015, 1:32 am - Stephen Browett: Also sorry it took so long to reply, whatsapp wanted money again so I just ignored it until it stopped asking
19/08/2015, 1:32 am - Stephen Browett: üòÅ
19/08/2015, 5:19 am - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha
19/08/2015, 5:19 am - Solveig Andvig: Yes I had that problem for a while too...
19/08/2015, 5:19 am - Solveig Andvig: Just thin ice because I'm trying to argue a point I don't know anything about
19/08/2015, 10:58 am - Stephen Browett: Your argument should just be 'everybody, shut up and listen'
19/08/2015, 10:59 am - Stephen Browett: You'll make loads of friends haha
19/08/2015, 11:08 am - Solveig Andvig: Hahahha
19/08/2015, 11:09 am - Solveig Andvig: Yes!!
28/09/2015, 1:26 am - Stephen Browett: Why am I seeing errors when I try and reply to you?
28/09/2015, 1:26 am - Stephen Browett: And i can't see your profile any more
28/09/2015, 1:26 am - Stephen Browett: Have you blocked me?! üò≠
28/09/2015, 5:33 am - Solveig Andvig: No of course not :-) why would I make sure you didn't teach me on fb but you could still contact me here?
28/09/2015, 5:33 am - Solveig Andvig: I've just deactivated my fb account for a little while, it is better that way
28/09/2015, 8:23 am - Stephen Browett: It's better?
28/09/2015, 8:24 am - Stephen Browett: What does that mean?
28/09/2015, 11:48 am - Solveig Andvig: It just means that fb is evil üòà
28/09/2015, 5:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Why can't we just go back to the good old days of actually talking to people?!
28/09/2015, 5:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Facebook sucks
28/09/2015, 5:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes
28/09/2015, 5:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Btw I'm back on now
28/09/2015, 5:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: This is why I hate it
28/09/2015, 5:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have to go online for information or to talk to people
28/09/2015, 5:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Everyone who I've asked "why do you use Facebook?" inevitably reply "because everyone else is on it"
28/09/2015, 5:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Nobody seems to actually like it
28/09/2015, 5:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah
28/09/2015, 5:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Or maybe it's just cool to bash Facebook and we're slaves to trends :p
28/09/2015, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Noooo
28/09/2015, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: üôà

23/01/2017, 1:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
23/01/2017, 1:53 pm - Stephen Browett: It seemed like a good skill to put on the at least
23/01/2017, 2:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Of course it is! I was just being mean üòê
23/01/2017, 2:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: üêù

23/01/2017, 2:56 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm in my final year (technically, even though I've got 1.5 years left) so I need to start keeping an eye out for jobs :p
23/01/2017, 2:56 pm - Stephen Browett: It's terrifying lol

23/01/2017, 3:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: And do you know what you want to do?
23/01/2017, 4:16 pm - Stephen Browett: Truth be told, I haven't thought about it that much
23/01/2017, 4:16 pm - Stephen Browett: With still a year to go I feel like there's a lot left to do
23/01/2017, 4:16 pm - Stephen Browett: But designing satellites would be good
23/01/2017, 4:17 pm - Stephen Browett: So maybe something in the telecommunications industry
23/01/2017, 5:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounds like a good idea!
23/01/2017, 5:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Have you checked out Surrey satellite technologies or something? It works with the university there or something
23/01/2017, 5:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also, you have airbus defence &vspace located in the UK
23/01/2017, 5:30 pm - Stephen Browett: It's a fine line between aerospace and defence but I'm not sure how I'd feel about my work being used to kill people :/
23/01/2017, 5:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah yes
23/01/2017, 5:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Go for Surrey then!
23/01/2017, 5:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
23/01/2017, 5:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbf, I've just had a quick look and that's not a bad shout!
23/01/2017, 5:33 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll definitely bear them in mind, thanks :)
23/01/2017, 5:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yay! I did well
23/01/2017, 5:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah
23/01/2017, 5:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you know all the satellite companies now you work for one? :p
23/01/2017, 5:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Only the ones we're in contact with...
23/01/2017, 5:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: There are so many!
23/04/2017, 11:30 am - Solveig Andvig: How did the 10k run go today?
23/04/2017, 11:30 am - Solveig Andvig: I went through Southampton on my way to Heathrow airport and all the streets were closed down so the bus driver ended up being trapped haha üòÇ
23/04/2017, 9:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha as long as you didn't miss your flight I'm not sorry :p
23/04/2017, 9:46 pm - Stephen Browett: It was exhausting!
23/04/2017, 9:46 pm - Stephen Browett: I finished about 1200th out of 1600 haha
23/04/2017, 9:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Not great but I'm dead chuffed :)
23/04/2017, 9:47 pm - Stephen Browett: And I beat the Southampton football club mascot which is the main thing
23/04/2017, 9:49 pm - Stephen Browett: You have a good flight back?
24/04/2017, 4:43 am - Solveig Andvig: I'm really impressed! I don't think I could have finished it at all üòÇ maybe next year and I'll start practising now!
24/04/2017, 8:39 am - Stephen Browett: Definitely! And we had sunny weather over here instead of snow haha
24/04/2017, 9:11 am - Solveig Andvig: üòí
24/04/2017, 9:11 am - Solveig Andvig: It's still snowing
24/04/2017, 9:11 am - Solveig Andvig: Pretty shit
24/04/2017, 6:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Wow, this can't be typical for this time of year, can it?
24/04/2017, 6:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Meh, sometimes it is
24/04/2017, 6:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: But we haven't really had winter this year so I wanted to get summer now
24/04/2017, 6:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, I can imagine
24/04/2017, 6:04 pm - Stephen Browett: I bet the weather meant you got out of your holiday mentality quite abruptly
24/04/2017, 6:04 pm - Stephen Browett: How was Leeds btw?
24/04/2017, 6:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: It was great! üòÑ
24/04/2017, 6:07 pm - Stephen Browett: How was everyone?
24/04/2017, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Tired really haha
24/04/2017, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: David and James were okay, it was nice seeing them again
24/04/2017, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: I haven't seen James since I graduated in 2013
24/04/2017, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò±
24/04/2017, 6:14 pm - Stephen Browett: That's crazy! Way too long lol
24/04/2017, 6:14 pm - Stephen Browett: What are they up to now?
24/04/2017, 6:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: So James is looking for a job or a phd but doesn't have a job ATM
24/04/2017, 6:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: And David is working on his phd
24/04/2017, 6:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Such a shame that James hasn't been able to find anything yet
24/04/2017, 6:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Is David's PhD going well do you know?
24/04/2017, 7:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: He said he's struggling because the guys who provide the software he uses are crap and it's not working ATM
24/04/2017, 7:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: So he can't really finish off his two papers he's working on
24/04/2017, 7:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: But it's a matter of chasing them down
24/04/2017, 7:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: And he said that he hasn't really found any breakthroughs, he's just reporting on "everything's as usual"
24/04/2017, 7:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounded like he'll be done in year and a half time? Which I thought was when you were done
24/04/2017, 7:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: So I'm not sure if it's been extended or not
24/04/2017, 11:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Ah that's a shame but hopefully it won't take him too much longer to chase those guys up
24/04/2017, 11:05 pm - Stephen Browett: And then it's good that he's got 2 papers coming out of it
24/04/2017, 11:06 pm - Stephen Browett: And yeah, that's about the time that I finish so maybe David had 4 years?
24/04/2017, 11:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Maybe! I don't know really
24/04/2017, 11:45 pm - Stephen Browett: As long as he gets there lol
24/04/2017, 11:45 pm - Stephen Browett: And what else did you get up to in Leeds?
24/04/2017, 11:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hmm.. I went shopping and exploring on my own, and one of the days I stayed at home alone because I needed it. And we went out for a nice meal one night and later to a bar. Also spent a lot of time catching up with Lena üòä
25/04/2017, 12:26 am - Stephen Browett: Was it nice having the time to yourself or not?
25/04/2017, 12:26 am - Stephen Browett: I hope you're OK üôÇ
25/04/2017, 5:25 am - Solveig Andvig: Not really.. I'm feeling quite down and don't really know how to process things. When I'm alone it's the worst, but it's also the only time I get to have a proper think about things. At home I get too much of it but when I was in the U.K. I was constantly around people so I didn't feel I could ground myself.. it's truly the worst thing I've been through so far in my life üòè
25/04/2017, 8:57 am - Stephen Browett: Solveig! I'm so sorry ‚òπ
25/04/2017, 8:58 am - Stephen Browett: You're too good for him anyway if this is how he treats you
25/04/2017, 8:58 am - Stephen Browett: Do you want to talk through it?
25/04/2017, 9:08 am - Solveig Andvig: Maybe.. I wouldn't really know where to start
25/04/2017, 9:13 am - Stephen Browett: Well you had last weekend to chat over things so how did that go?
25/04/2017, 9:20 am - Solveig Andvig: It was emotional and he said he needs more time to get his head sorted... he says he misses me and when we were together it felt like nothing had changed. Which scared him but to me that was th proof that it was a mistake to break up in the first place. he says he can't go back to the way things were, but the problem was that instead of talking about our issues he just ended it. And then He chose not to talk to me for almost two weeks. And while I was there he was keeping me at a distance once he felt I got "too close". So what he wants to do is to take things slow to make sure we get it right if this is what we want to continue. But I struggle because he's broken my trust and I don't feel safe he's not flirting with someone else or that he won't hurt me again üòû
25/04/2017, 9:22 am - Solveig Andvig: He's coming to see me in Oslo in may to discuss things further and in the meantime he wants to only write me letters because the main thing which caused all of this was be communication via phone
25/04/2017, 9:23 am - Solveig Andvig: I feel very lost.. I want to make it work but I wish we could have spent some more time together because he's going away for 6 months in June and it will be really tough if things are still uncertain then.
25/04/2017, 11:58 am - Stephen Browett: When is he coming over in May? This is a long time to be dragging this uncertainty out for which will only be making both of you feel bad
25/04/2017, 11:59 am - Stephen Browett: What makes you question whether he's firing with someone else?
25/04/2017, 12:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: 12-14th may
25/04/2017, 12:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think it's a long time too üòû but at the moment I feel my hands are tied and that's what makes me feel upset
25/04/2017, 12:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have a choice of waiting, which I struggle with, or just give up on it, which is not what I want
25/04/2017, 12:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well, just stories from how he acted out in the past when he went out of a relationship... and when he was ignoring me he was out drinking to forget about everything. I don't trust that he didn't try to be with someone then to "get over it all". I asked him and it feels like he's leaving out information which is why I don't feel I can trust him. I think it's better with brutal honesty than trying to spare my feelings. At least then I know what's going on.
25/04/2017, 12:51 pm - Stephen Browett: I guess he could be actually telling the truth and you're just worried?
25/04/2017, 12:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you think after all this that you guys could have a proper relationship?
25/04/2017, 12:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes I probably am worried... I am trying to convince myself that he is but when I don't get to talk with him to clarify things I struggle üòû
25/04/2017, 12:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think so, if we can put things behind us. I can if he starts showing that he actually wants this. Now I can see from his body language he wants to be with me, but his head is unsure because he is hurt too. üòî I wish I was in the same country as him now. It would make things so much easier.
25/04/2017, 6:51 pm - Stephen Browett: I think if you guys can cut through all the crap then you'd have a much better chance at it
25/04/2017, 6:51 pm - Stephen Browett: As in you've said that you get the impression he's trying to protect your feelings and the best way is just to be honest
25/04/2017, 6:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe talking it over down the phone wouldn't be a terrible idea as it's a little less personal so you might soak your minds?
25/04/2017, 6:53 pm - Stephen Browett: The down side ofc is that it's down the phone and it's less personal lol
25/04/2017, 7:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah.. wish I just didn't feel anything, it would make life easier
25/04/2017, 7:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: The snow we were meant to get for Christmas just turned up
25/04/2017, 7:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
25/04/2017, 7:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's strange how it was 25 degrees when I left and this is what I come back to?!
26/04/2017, 4:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, the weather is being well weird
26/04/2017, 4:42 pm - Stephen Browett: It was hailing in town today while on campus it's been glorious sunshine
26/04/2017, 4:42 pm - Stephen Browett: Only 3 miles apart, go figure
26/04/2017, 5:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Wow
26/04/2017, 5:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Strange times
27/04/2017, 3:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Did you ever go through a heart break?
27/04/2017, 4:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Just the once
27/04/2017, 4:23 pm - Stephen Browett: My ex girlfriend decided she'd rather make out with one of my mates at home while I was at uni
27/04/2017, 4:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh üòû
27/04/2017, 4:24 pm - Stephen Browett: The betrayal made it easier in a way
27/04/2017, 4:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, I said that to Magnus as well.. that it's more difficult because there isn't an obvious reason like that
27/04/2017, 4:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: How did you get over it?
27/04/2017, 4:28 pm - Stephen Browett: You always get over it in time
27/04/2017, 4:28 pm - Stephen Browett: It helped more when I stopped seeing and talking to her
27/04/2017, 4:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ugh... time üòí
27/04/2017, 4:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah.. I've been very close to just deleting everything about him from my life
27/04/2017, 4:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: But I struggle so much
27/04/2017, 4:29 pm - Stephen Browett: ‚òπ
27/04/2017, 4:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: If I regret it the next day then the ship has sailed
27/04/2017, 4:32 pm - Stephen Browett: And that's the tricky bit, your heart is telling you to hold on while your brain is saying "get rid"
27/04/2017, 4:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Either way, you'll survive
27/04/2017, 4:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes üòîüòî
27/04/2017, 4:33 pm - Stephen Browett: You're awesome, don't forget that üôÇ
27/04/2017, 4:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I try to remind myself but it's not so easy.. but thanks
27/04/2017, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: What's going on in your head right now?
27/04/2017, 4:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Too much. I'm trying to control my emotions but I struggle. I damage things when I'm emotional. It's not healthy, but I can go from feeling like I can cope with it all to feeling like my life is broken and I have nothing left.
27/04/2017, 4:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Well that's what time is very good at sorting out
27/04/2017, 4:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you think it's over for you guys then?
27/04/2017, 4:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: The problem is that time still hasn't been healing things from my past so it seems to just accumulate and make things worse
27/04/2017, 4:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: There's too much happening in too short time and it's overwhelming
27/04/2017, 4:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: I feel like this lack of interaction is more damaging than helpful right now. He's going away for a long period of time and I'd like to find time to talk things through before that...
27/04/2017, 4:55 pm - Stephen Browett: These things are always a roller-coaster but you always have friends to help you out
27/04/2017, 4:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Or to talk to
27/04/2017, 4:55 pm - Stephen Browett: When does he go? How long do you have left to talk to him?
27/04/2017, 4:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes but most of my friends are so far away that it's difficult üòî it's not the same as talking in person
27/04/2017, 5:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh, he goes in June
27/04/2017, 5:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm unsure about the date
27/04/2017, 5:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: And he wants us to only converse via letter before the 12th may really, which seems impossible
27/04/2017, 5:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't understand the thinking there...
27/04/2017, 5:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: No me neither
27/04/2017, 5:24 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh, I thought you'd have had an explanation for that?
27/04/2017, 5:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well, only that he's scared we'll mess things up by talking in any other way
27/04/2017, 5:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Apparently we do best in person or via letters
27/04/2017, 5:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Well, I understand where he's coming from but it's stupid
29/06/2017, 7:54 am - Solveig Andvig: Happy birthday! üòÑüéâ
29/06/2017, 7:59 am - Stephen Browett: Thank you :)
29/06/2017, 7:59 am - Stephen Browett: I'm back in the UK now so I'll be better at replying to messages, at least for a while lol
29/06/2017, 9:00 am - Solveig Andvig: About time üòâ
29/06/2017, 9:00 am - Solveig Andvig: Have you had a good time in America?
29/06/2017, 9:11 am - Stephen Browett: It was awesome thank you üòÅ
29/06/2017, 9:11 am - Stephen Browett: There will be lots of NYC skyline photos appearing over the next few days lol
29/06/2017, 9:12 am - Stephen Browett: Once I steal them from Katie who had a proper camera üòÇ
29/06/2017, 9:15 am - Solveig Andvig: Looking forward to see them üòä
29/06/2017, 9:35 am - Stephen Browett: Also, just noticed that my other messages didn't send on insta
29/06/2017, 9:35 am - Stephen Browett: Sorry about that
29/06/2017, 9:38 am - Solveig Andvig: It's okay üëåüèº
29/06/2017, 9:39 am - Solveig Andvig: And thanks for the tip on the sand lol
29/06/2017, 10:03 am - Stephen Browett: Np üòÖ
29/06/2017, 10:03 am - Stephen Browett: I may have had a drink at that point...
29/06/2017, 10:04 am - Solveig Andvig: That's when you get the best ideas though üí°
29/06/2017, 10:17 am - Stephen Browett: Haha definitely but the ideas become really bad really quickly :p
29/06/2017, 10:18 am - Stephen Browett: You've seen the 'pint and a half society' comedy sketch?
29/06/2017, 10:19 am - Stephen Browett: You can solve the world's problems after a pint and a half but any more and everything goes to pot
29/06/2017, 10:21 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah you told me last time but you never sent me the link so I expect to receive it this time üòÖ
29/06/2017, 10:32 am - Stephen Browett: https://youtu.be/VTSCppeFzX4
29/06/2017, 10:32 am - Stephen Browett: Got it üëç
29/06/2017, 10:54 am - Solveig Andvig: üòÑ
29/06/2017, 10:54 am - Solveig Andvig: Will have a look after work
29/06/2017, 11:42 am - Stephen Browett: Laaame! At work today
29/06/2017, 11:42 am - Stephen Browett: It should be an international holiday
29/06/2017, 12:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol mine is
30/06/2017, 5:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: https://www.facebook.com/goalcast/videos/1331669713576882/
01/07/2017, 1:12 am - Stephen Browett: He says the truth! Makes you think, doesn't it?
01/07/2017, 9:30 am - Solveig Andvig: Yes absolutely
20/07/2017, 10:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: I need some advise about the whole situation regarding Magnus... üòï
20/07/2017, 10:57 pm - Stephen Browett: What's happened now?
20/07/2017, 10:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: No, not happened
20/07/2017, 10:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm just struggling... even after everything we've been through now I still feel like he's the right one for me
20/07/2017, 10:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: And the thing is that I know he loves me too, but that he's hurt which is why he's acting like a dick
20/07/2017, 10:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I just have no clue whether or not I should ever try to contact him or meet up with him again
20/07/2017, 11:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: I just can't get my mind off it... I've tried meeting new people and I'm trying to do new things with my life but it doesn't change this feeling deep inside that something's missing from my life now
20/07/2017, 11:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbf you've not been broken up for long
20/07/2017, 11:02 pm - Stephen Browett: They say it takes half the time of the relationship plus a month to get one someone
20/07/2017, 11:02 pm - Stephen Browett: I've found that surprisingly true
20/07/2017, 11:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòî
20/07/2017, 11:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: It just feels different
20/07/2017, 11:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: I can't explain it
20/07/2017, 11:12 pm - Stephen Browett: I know it's clich√© but does it feel life your adjusting to live without someone who feels that way about you?
20/07/2017, 11:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hmm, no, not really
20/07/2017, 11:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: I've always been independent and I don't need him in my life
20/07/2017, 11:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: The difference is that I want him in my life, which is rare because usually I only care about myself
20/07/2017, 11:20 pm - Stephen Browett: That's not true, you've always carted about your friends
20/07/2017, 11:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you not spoken to him at all?
20/07/2017, 11:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes, but it's differently with friends because the ones that matter are so far away... there's not a chance for anyone to be involved in my life really
20/07/2017, 11:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: I tried for a while but it didn't make me any wiser
20/07/2017, 11:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: He just seems scared of me and want to keep me at a distance
20/07/2017, 11:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know this seems really stupid and naive and I hate myself for it but I can't put this feeling aside üòï
20/07/2017, 11:38 pm - Stephen Browett: Well when has anyone ever felt one way because it's the most reasoned way? Emotions are stubborn like that
20/07/2017, 11:38 pm - Stephen Browett: Did you apply for those jobs in the UK?
20/07/2017, 11:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes I hate emotions right now... üòù
20/07/2017, 11:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: I haven't applied yet because I have people visiting but I will do at the weekend!
20/07/2017, 11:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know I need to do something with my life
20/07/2017, 11:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha of you figure out what that is you have to let everyone else know how you did it :p
24/07/2017, 4:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: You've been cooking! Very impressive home made stuff üòÑ
24/07/2017, 4:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Thanks lol I've been meaning to do it for ages
24/07/2017, 4:53 pm - Stephen Browett: The chilli jam is so good! üòã
24/07/2017, 4:54 pm - Stephen Browett: All the sugar!
24/07/2017, 4:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes a lot of sugar üòÇüòÑ
24/07/2017, 4:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: How much do you have left?
24/07/2017, 5:01 pm - Stephen Browett: About 2 litres üòá
24/07/2017, 5:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Would you like some?
24/07/2017, 5:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Of course!
24/07/2017, 5:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Did you say you are planning on coming over here soon?
24/07/2017, 5:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Possibly!
24/07/2017, 5:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: If I get work
24/07/2017, 5:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Yay! Your moving in present will be chilli jam üòù
24/07/2017, 5:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Or whatever else I make between then and now lol
24/07/2017, 5:19 pm - Stephen Browett: You put any more thought into getting work over here or have you got enough going on right now? Lol
24/07/2017, 5:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes! I've even updated my CV üòÑ
24/07/2017, 5:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: So as soon as someone offers me a job I'm interested in I'll take it!
18/08/2017, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: So... I tried talking to magnus again in July to see if things had calmed down and he could give me more of an explanation to what happened because to this day I still don't know why we have broken up. That didn't go too well, he was busy on a course and barely had time to talk to me so I told him that instead of me contacting him, he could contact me when he had time... it's now been almost a month and the course was due to end a week after I contacted him. Now I received a message out of the blue asking how I'm doing. No added sentence of "sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, I've been busy etc, just a "hey, how are you?"" . I don't even know if I want to reply to it now. I'm not someone he can talk to only when it pleases him. If he wants to be in my life he needs to make more of an effort, especially because of the way he has behaved towards me. Am I being unreasonable?
18/08/2017, 8:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Not at all! He's clearly still not OK with something, whatever that is
18/08/2017, 8:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Either shout at him or ignore it
18/08/2017, 8:47 pm - Stephen Browett: He'll get the message that way lol
18/08/2017, 8:47 pm - Stephen Browett: You alright?
18/08/2017, 8:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha, I think I'll ignore it
18/08/2017, 8:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, just exhausted from work
18/08/2017, 8:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm annoyed because I'm still struggling with my feelings towards him but he's giving me every reason to move on from him
18/08/2017, 8:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: I just need to be able to let go...
18/08/2017, 9:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Going through the socially (colloquially) accepted stages of a break up, are you reaching the point of thinking about meeting someone else yet?
18/08/2017, 9:12 pm - Stephen Browett: That could help lol
18/08/2017, 9:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes and no
18/08/2017, 9:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm meeting new people and chatting but only as friends
18/08/2017, 9:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don't believe I can find someone just by looking for them
18/08/2017, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Well, it won't be immediate, that's for sure
18/08/2017, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: But you're a catch, buddy
18/08/2017, 10:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Any guy would be lucky to have you
18/08/2017, 10:02 pm - Stephen Browett: üòä
18/08/2017, 10:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know that üòâ
18/08/2017, 10:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha so it hasn't affected your confidence then? üòú
18/08/2017, 10:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: Quite the contrary. He made me feel like I was a mean person and a psychopath. He made me question myself and hate myself. I know none of those things are true now, and in fact, I think it was him portraying his own insecurities on to me; he is the mean person and the psychopath. He's held me back and made me believe that his behavior is normal and acceptable when it's not. I have come to realize that he thought he loved me and made me believe so, but he never truly did. He was afraid to open up to me and when one can't open up and be fully transparent you can't really say you love someone. I don't have time for people who are afraid of their feelings, and they're not worth my time.
18/08/2017, 10:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you think you would have ever figured that out if you hadn't broken up?
18/08/2017, 10:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don't know
18/08/2017, 10:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think I already knew, I just had a different perception of what kind of person he was; I thought he could talk with me about what bothered him at least. I'm probably one of the least judging kinds of people, and also one of the most supporting ones so I don't know what he is afraid of.
18/08/2017, 10:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: If he could explain to me why he felt like we needed to break up I'd accept it without having to go through all this shit also. I don't force people to do things and as long as I have an explanation I can move on.
18/08/2017, 11:01 pm - Stephen Browett: He can't see you're like that because he's nothing like that and can't comprehend it
18/08/2017, 11:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe the fact that you can see all these things now means it's a good thing you guys broke up
18/08/2017, 11:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Probably
18/08/2017, 11:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: In a way I hate the way I feel about him because it makes me feel weak, and I know that he can easily drag me into misery again if we were to start talking again and he didn't treat me right
18/08/2017, 11:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: I want to talk with him, and I want to be with him but I know I shouldn't
25/08/2017, 5:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: *drum solo*
25/08/2017, 5:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
25/08/2017, 5:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: Tadaaaaaa
25/08/2017, 5:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Woo! Well done! üòÑüòÑüéäüéâüéä
25/08/2017, 5:41 pm - Stephen Browett: 6th of September is soon, you need to book some flights!
25/08/2017, 5:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: It is soon! Too soon!
25/08/2017, 5:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: I need to ask if it can be postponed a week or if Skype is acceptable because I hand in two big proposals that week...
25/08/2017, 5:44 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm sure Skype will be fine, lots of people do it
25/08/2017, 5:45 pm - Stephen Browett: You'll smash it though, I bet :)
25/08/2017, 5:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ahh, I'm nervous
25/08/2017, 5:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: I really want the position
25/08/2017, 5:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you know what kind of research they do at Bristol?
25/08/2017, 5:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: Quantum engineering
25/08/2017, 5:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Sounds scary üòù
25/08/2017, 5:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Well I'm sure they'll ask you a few conceptual questions on that at least
25/08/2017, 6:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Possibly, but they didn't mention specifically that I needed any qualifications from that area, the project management experience seemed more important
25/08/2017, 7:44 pm - Stephen Browett: That seems reasonable, I've never been good at interviews, don't take my advice lol
26/08/2017, 11:27 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha you've interviewed for uni jobs before though, so you have more experience than me
26/08/2017, 11:27 am - Solveig Andvig: I have no idea what kind of questions they'll ask
26/08/2017, 12:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha well if yours will be like anything in my experience then it will be super informal :p
26/08/2017, 12:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Let's hope so!
26/08/2017, 12:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: I like informal
29/08/2017, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: I didn't realise that I could use whatsapp on my desktop! this is great =D
29/08/2017, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'd prefer to talk to people on here instead of using fb
29/08/2017, 9:45 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha technology is great isn't it? üòù
29/08/2017, 9:45 pm - Stephen Browett: And yeah fb messenger is awful
29/08/2017, 9:45 pm - Stephen Browett: How you doing?
30/08/2017, 6:24 am - Solveig Andvig: Overworked and not too happy with it at the moment ‚òπ
30/08/2017, 6:24 am - Solveig Andvig: I want a break
30/08/2017, 6:24 am - Solveig Andvig: How are you?
30/08/2017, 2:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Bored, supervisors aren't replying to emails so I'm just doing other work while I wait
30/08/2017, 2:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Actually I'm at a summer school this week
30/08/2017, 2:02 pm - Stephen Browett: It's super boring!
30/08/2017, 4:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I've heard the summer school is often fun?? why not?
30/08/2017, 4:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: be happy that you don't have huge pressure on you like I do
30/08/2017, 4:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: ;)
30/08/2017, 5:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Send day when I'm so bored, any way I can help? üòù
30/08/2017, 5:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you have a deadline coming or something?
30/08/2017, 5:11 pm - Solveig Andvig: yeah, it's the Friday that week!
30/08/2017, 5:15 pm - Stephen Browett: What's on Friday, which week?
30/08/2017, 5:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: the deadline is on next friday, and my interview is on wednesday next week :)
30/08/2017, 5:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: which is why I want to either postpone it or have it on skype because travelling would take too long in the middle of a really hectic period
30/08/2017, 5:16 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you not heard back about that yet?!
30/08/2017, 5:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: no :|
30/08/2017, 5:18 pm - Stephen Browett: You can stop at mine if you need accommodation at the last minute
30/08/2017, 5:18 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm about 1.5-2 hours from Bristol
30/08/2017, 5:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: that's really kind of you! I might take you up on that offer :) I'll let you know
30/08/2017, 5:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm surprised they haven't said anything yet, it's a week until the interview and no details
30/08/2017, 5:19 pm - Stephen Browett: They're probably just running behind
30/08/2017, 5:19 pm - Stephen Browett: And people are always busy
30/08/2017, 5:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: so am I!
30/08/2017, 5:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: and I may have to buy plane tickets to get there also
30/08/2017, 5:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha it's not ideal üòù
30/08/2017, 5:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: no, but it's difficult to see these challenges if you're not experiencing it yourself :P
30/08/2017, 5:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: how are you on a general basis though? it's been a while since we last spoke
30/08/2017, 5:24 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm not sure, I'm trying to decide what I want but not making much headway with it
30/08/2017, 5:24 pm - Stephen Browett: Mostly because it's complicated by thinking about what I want to do after my PhD
30/08/2017, 5:24 pm - Stephen Browett: That definitely needs figuring out lol
30/08/2017, 5:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: haha, yes, but don't stress about it
30/08/2017, 5:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: what I've found is that if I just let things happen then I find my way, the minute I stress about something it just gets fucked up
30/08/2017, 5:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: it gives you time to always do what you want to do instead of living up to people's expectations
30/08/2017, 5:27 pm - Stephen Browett: True but I get too fidgety not being proactive lol
30/08/2017, 5:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: in that case: find out what you did when you really enjoyed life and go and do that
30/08/2017, 5:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Not a bad idea üí°
30/08/2017, 5:42 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm sure I'm just stressed though, it'll pass
30/08/2017, 5:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: sounds like it ;)
30/08/2017, 5:42 pm - Stephen Browett: Next July, when my thesis is in :p
30/08/2017, 5:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: plenty of time
30/08/2017, 5:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: lots of jobs you can take also
30/08/2017, 5:43 pm - Stephen Browett: True! There's a careers planning session on Thursday than I'm looking forward to
30/08/2017, 5:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: you get those??? then what are you stressing about! just relax and take one day at a time :)
30/08/2017, 5:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know it's easy for me to say
30/08/2017, 5:44 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha tbh there's probably more truth in there than you give yourself credit for
30/08/2017, 5:45 pm - Stephen Browett: How do you de-stress?
30/08/2017, 5:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: good question, I don't often show how stressed I am, I feel it in my body, so first thing is to find something which takes my mind off things because often I don't notice how stressed I am
30/08/2017, 5:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: could be going out for a walk, go to a quiz, a concert, the gym, just anything different from what I normally do
30/08/2017, 5:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: I make sure to really observe and sense everything around me so that I know I am living in the current moment, not the past, not hte future
30/08/2017, 5:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: then I try to find out what is important to me in life because it puts things into perspective
30/08/2017, 5:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: and I remind myself that every time I've had a difficult time in the past there has been some form of solution to it, and that I don't really have to stress about it
30/08/2017, 5:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: oh, and it helps to be around friends that make me laugh :)
30/08/2017, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I think that's what's missing at this summer school
30/08/2017, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: After the last session everyone just stood up and marched back to the hotel
30/08/2017, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Nobody wanted to go to the pub
30/08/2017, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: So I don't really feel like I'm getting to know people to have a laugh with
30/08/2017, 5:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Super boring üí§
30/08/2017, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: why not go out to th epub and make your own friends? hahah
30/08/2017, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know it sounds sad, but it might be better than sitting inside and being stressed
30/08/2017, 10:53 pm - Stephen Browett: We managed to get 8 people out tonight, record breaking lol
30/08/2017, 10:53 pm - Stephen Browett: I do feel a lot better üòÑ
31/08/2017, 9:40 am - Solveig Andvig: Perfect!
01/09/2017, 10:47 am - Solveig Andvig: I don't know why it's more expensive to go to Southampton from London instead of directly to Bristol
01/09/2017, 12:45 pm - Stephen Browett: Is it really? Haha go figure
01/09/2017, 12:45 pm - Stephen Browett: It's because Southampton is so posh :p
01/09/2017, 12:46 pm - Stephen Browett: You'd like to stay at mine for the interview then?
01/09/2017, 3:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Since you offered üôÇ I was wondering if I could combine it with a visit but I need to work out the logistics of this first! It seems to be a bit difficult at the moment but I'll get my head around it this weekend
02/09/2017, 10:57 am - Stephen Browett: You are more than welcome to stop at ours
02/09/2017, 10:59 am - Stephen Browett: Holly and I are busy on the Saturday though, just so you know
02/09/2017, 11:05 am - Stephen Browett: But we will definitely go for a celebratory drink after your interview üòÑ
04/09/2017, 12:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm currently trying to sort out the interview now
04/09/2017, 12:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: I hope to postpone it but I'm not sure
04/09/2017, 1:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Sure, let me know how that goes :)
04/09/2017, 1:35 pm - Stephen Browett: You can have the sofa or the airbed, it's up to you
04/09/2017, 1:35 pm - Stephen Browett: The sofa is more comfy if you ask me though üòõ
04/09/2017, 1:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Okay, so they told me the following:
04/09/2017, 1:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
04/09/2017, 1:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don't want to skip this meeting because my excuse will be that I'm "ill". If I get the job they will know I lied and trust me less and probably make my remaining time a little less enjoyable, while if I don't get it they will think I'm fragile and can't handle the stress because there's been a lot of work lately and they know that. So I'm scared they'll treat me differently.
04/09/2017, 1:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm not sure if I should bend over backwards for an organization that cannot be flexible to my schedule also; I'll be making a huge effort to come to Bristol from Norway for an interview and it is all on their terms: not a good way to start a new employer-employee relationship
04/09/2017, 1:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don't know what's normal in the U.K. But here at least they would normally be more flexible
04/09/2017, 1:48 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm surprised they couldn't rearrange, how long had you asked to delay?
04/09/2017, 1:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Two days
04/09/2017, 1:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: So that I can manage to get there on time
04/09/2017, 1:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Wow, that's all?!
04/09/2017, 1:49 pm - Stephen Browett: It's not like they'd have hired someone by the weekend!
04/09/2017, 1:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Seems like they want to have made a choice by the end of Wednesday
04/09/2017, 1:50 pm - Stephen Browett: It's up to you, ultimately of you want the job then you might have to pull a sickie
04/09/2017, 1:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Alternatively, if you think this doesn't bode well for what the working environment will be like there then cancel the interview
04/09/2017, 1:52 pm - Stephen Browett: What are you thinking?
04/09/2017, 1:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm really torn
04/09/2017, 1:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: If I'm to pull a sickie now then people will start treating me differently in my current job because they know I'm exhausted ATM and working really hard so they will think I can't take care of myself
04/09/2017, 1:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I don't like the vibe they're giving me: I want the job but not at any cost, I mean, who is so locked down to a date??
04/09/2017, 1:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: They sent out the details on Friday!
04/09/2017, 1:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: They gave me a warning the Friday before and I asked for more details and no reply
04/09/2017, 4:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Plus, what image of yourself would you give to the place your applying to if you'll do everything to have an interview elsewhere?
04/09/2017, 4:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Drop, not do
04/09/2017, 4:09 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm not really sure there's a 'right' answer here
04/09/2017, 4:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Just pull a sickie and come to visit haha
04/09/2017, 4:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: lol! I'll come and visit some other time =)
04/09/2017, 4:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm going to leeds twice this autumn actually
04/09/2017, 4:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'll find time to visit southampton too =)
04/09/2017, 4:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: also, I'd like to go to cardiff for the christmas market so I need to ask some people to come with me for that hahaha
04/09/2017, 4:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: are you interested?
05/09/2017, 12:19 am - Stephen Browett: Hell yeah! That would be awesome!
05/09/2017, 12:19 am - Stephen Browett: Do you know when abouts you'll be visiting? I'll keep my schedule free üòÑ
05/09/2017, 7:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don't know yet!
05/09/2017, 7:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: is there a particular time which is good for you?
05/09/2017, 8:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Whenever, I don't plan that far ahead lol
05/09/2017, 8:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Any time in November or early December (I assume that's when the Christmas market is on) is fine with me üôÇ
05/09/2017, 9:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: perfect, I'll find time for it :D
05/09/2017, 11:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Burn your flat down
05/09/2017, 11:13 pm - Stephen Browett: It's the only way
06/09/2017, 5:45 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol!!! Where did that come from?
06/09/2017, 8:15 am - Stephen Browett: Because of the spider in your snapchat üòÑ
06/09/2017, 8:45 am - Solveig Andvig: lol!!! Haha I thought you were referring to finding a date to come to the U.K. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
06/09/2017, 9:02 am - Stephen Browett: Haha just burn your flat down so you have to come to the UK now üòÜ
06/09/2017, 9:03 am - Solveig Andvig: I thought it was a bit drastic, I'll come and see you anyway üòÖ
15/09/2017, 12:08 am - Stephen Browett: Why have you not killed that spider yet?!
15/09/2017, 12:08 am - Stephen Browett: üò±
15/09/2017, 6:01 am - Solveig Andvig: Because I can't kill it, I kicked it out but it obviously came back in or left his family
15/09/2017, 11:40 am - Stephen Browett: If you killed it it wouldn't come back, just sayin' üï∑
15/09/2017, 12:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol üòÇ I know
15/09/2017, 7:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: What about 24th - 26th November for a weekend in Cardiff with some sightseeing, Christmas market and other fun??
15/09/2017, 11:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Is the 24th a Friday?
15/09/2017, 11:42 pm - Stephen Browett: I think I can do the weekend though :)
15/09/2017, 11:43 pm - Stephen Browett: Would you be stopping over in Cardiff?
16/09/2017, 5:27 am - Solveig Andvig: It is yes üòä
16/09/2017, 5:28 am - Solveig Andvig: And it depends on what we'll get up to where I am staying
14/10/2017, 9:09 am - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
14/10/2017, 10:20 am - Stephen Browett: Can confirm these to be true
14/10/2017, 10:20 am - Stephen Browett: Especially the third one haha
14/10/2017, 10:32 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha üòÇ
14/10/2017, 10:32 am - Solveig Andvig: How was the trip you‚Äôve just been on? Pictures look amazing!
14/10/2017, 7:03 pm - Stephen Browett: It was amazing! Such an incredible experience as well
14/10/2017, 7:04 pm - Stephen Browett: The place was beautiful but untamed
14/10/2017, 7:04 pm - Stephen Browett: And the people were lovely (when they weren't drunk) haha
14/10/2017, 7:04 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll have some photos of my own coming up soon
14/10/2017, 7:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounds great üòÑ are you back in the UK now?
16/10/2017, 8:23 am - Stephen Browett: I am back in the UK now! It's good to be back, there's more food and less exercise over here haha
17/10/2017, 8:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah!
17/10/2017, 8:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: What food did you miss the most?
17/10/2017, 11:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Burgers lol
17/10/2017, 11:38 pm - Stephen Browett: We are told to avoid meat, especially red meat as it takes a while to digest and it's not comfortable to hike on a full stomach
17/10/2017, 11:38 pm - Stephen Browett: So I was almost competently vegetarian during my time there
17/10/2017, 11:39 pm - Stephen Browett: Which was fine but bacon tastes so good after 2 weeks without it haha
12/11/2017, 11:15 am - Solveig Andvig: how are you?
12/11/2017, 11:37 am - Stephen Browett: I'm doing OK, thanks üòä
12/11/2017, 11:38 am - Stephen Browett: Pretty stressed with work but I'm in Belfast this weekend with some of my old housemates from Aber so we're having a good time
12/11/2017, 11:38 am - Stephen Browett: How are you doing?
12/11/2017, 2:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: that sounds nice :) what are you guys doing?
12/11/2017, 2:11 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm good too! been working hard all year and it's finally calming down for maybe a few weeks before december hits us and everyone wants to finish their work before the holidays...
13/11/2017, 6:35 pm - Stephen Browett: We watched Ireland v south Africa rugby game
13/11/2017, 6:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Fantastic game for Ireland
13/11/2017, 6:35 pm - Stephen Browett: A disaster for south Africa haha
13/11/2017, 6:35 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm glad that things are calming down for you though
13/11/2017, 6:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you must gotten to the end of the project you've been working on then?
03/03/2018, 8:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
03/03/2018, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh and my bathroom is done!
03/03/2018, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
03/03/2018, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>

03/03/2018, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs an upgrade from this:

03/03/2018, 8:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: Btw now you don‚Äôt have any excuse to not come and visit! I have a spare guest room and a nice bathroom with extra towels waiting for you and holly
03/03/2018, 8:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: Get to Oslo airport and I‚Äôll also come and pick you up! üòÅ
04/03/2018, 5:32 pm - Stephen Browett: That looks like a totally different room! You've done an amazing job on that!
04/03/2018, 5:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Certainly a far cry from a floating sink with a pipe going into a drain on the ground üòÑ
04/03/2018, 5:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Did you do the work or did you contract someone else to do it?
04/03/2018, 5:34 pm - Stephen Browett: But we should definitely come round to see the place! I reckon I'll need a break whilst writing up
04/03/2018, 6:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: I had to get someone else to do it because of rules and regulations
04/03/2018, 6:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: But I chose the tiles and interior üòä
04/03/2018, 6:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: So are you finishing your PhD this spring?
04/03/2018, 8:10 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm due to finish at the end of June
04/03/2018, 8:10 pm - Stephen Browett: It's felt like a long time coming but now it seems too close lol
04/03/2018, 8:11 pm - Stephen Browett: You've decorated it beautifully though üòÑ
04/03/2018, 8:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: It will go really fast from now!
04/03/2018, 8:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you have any future plans?
06/03/2018, 3:39 pm - Stephen Browett: Not yet, trying to get the thesis done is quite overwhelming on its own lol
06/03/2018, 3:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Remember we used to chat about living the simple life off-the-grid?
06/03/2018, 3:40 pm - Stephen Browett: It's getting more appealing lol
07/03/2018, 7:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes! I‚Äôd love to just be a travel writer millionaire
07/03/2018, 10:48 pm - Stephen Browett: How hard can it be? üòù
07/03/2018, 10:51 pm - Stephen Browett: We'll start in Asia, I reckon
07/03/2018, 10:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines
07/03/2018, 10:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Then down to Australia, new Zealand and south Africa
07/03/2018, 10:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe trade south Africa for Japan... Less murder I think would be a good idea
08/03/2018, 6:56 am - Solveig Andvig: But South Africa is amazing!
08/03/2018, 6:56 am - Solveig Andvig: When do we go?
08/03/2018, 5:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Then both! Haha
08/03/2018, 5:10 pm - Stephen Browett: We go tomorrow afternoon
08/03/2018, 5:10 pm - Stephen Browett: I pack my bags, eat a huge fry up breakfast then get on a plane to Thailand
08/03/2018, 5:12 pm - Stephen Browett: üéíüéí‚úà‚úàüçúüçú
08/03/2018, 5:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Also, happy international women's day
09/03/2018, 3:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: How was your flight? üòÇ
09/03/2018, 9:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha well I got a far as eating the huge fry up üòÖ
10/03/2018, 8:02 am - Solveig Andvig: At least that‚Äôs a start!
26/08/2018, 8:35 am - Solveig Andvig: Hello stranger
27/08/2018, 5:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Heyy üòÉ
27/08/2018, 5:01 pm - Stephen Browett: I was in Wales this weekend so I've just popped over to Aber for the night
27/08/2018, 5:02 pm - Stephen Browett: It's like a little time capsule, it's so similar to how I remember it!
27/08/2018, 5:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: Amazing! Are you meeting up with David? I‚Äôm jealous!
27/08/2018, 7:50 pm - Stephen Browett: He's at Cari's this weekend but hopefully we'll be able to meet tonight or tomorrow morning üòÑ
27/08/2018, 7:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Although, Marcos is closed üò≠
27/08/2018, 7:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Literally the worst thing that could happen
27/08/2018, 7:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Aww
27/08/2018, 7:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Why did they close?
27/08/2018, 11:13 pm - Stephen Browett: I guess they weren't making enough money
27/08/2018, 11:13 pm - Stephen Browett: The notice on the door says that the owner hasn't paid any rent since November
27/08/2018, 11:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Ultimate lad üòÇ
28/08/2018, 7:14 am - Solveig Andvig: The weekends must surely be over? Why else am I in work? üò≤
28/08/2018, 7:14 am - Solveig Andvig: (As in why isn‚Äôt David back)
28/08/2018, 7:14 am - Solveig Andvig: And I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt make enough money - lots of people ate there!
28/08/2018, 10:15 am - Stephen Browett: It was a bank Holiday weekend this weekend
28/08/2018, 10:15 am - Stephen Browett: So no one was in work on Monday
28/08/2018, 10:22 am - Solveig Andvig: Ahh I see!
28/08/2018, 4:25 pm - Stephen Browett: I got your message from David btw üòù
28/08/2018, 8:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good!
28/08/2018, 9:09 pm - Stephen Browett: My bad üòü
28/08/2018, 9:10 pm - Stephen Browett: If I was going to get on organising a reunion, when would you be free?
28/08/2018, 9:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Probably from mid-October!
28/08/2018, 9:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Sweet! I'll check the availability for Mark's holiday let around that time and post in the group üòÑ
30/08/2018, 5:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do that!
30/08/2018, 5:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Would be great to see everyone again üòÅ
30/08/2018, 5:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Definitely!
30/08/2018, 5:34 pm - Stephen Browett: David told me that him and Cari are visiting you?
30/08/2018, 5:34 pm - Stephen Browett: That'll be good
30/08/2018, 5:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yep! They took me up on the offer unlike someone else I know üòâ
30/08/2018, 6:56 pm - Stephen Browett: ü§≠
30/08/2018, 6:56 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm unemployed atm! üòù
30/08/2018, 7:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: You could have got a job here but they‚Äôve hired lots of people now
30/08/2018, 7:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò¨
30/08/2018, 7:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: What will you be doing?
30/08/2018, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: I know, you were super kind giving me so much feedback as well
30/08/2018, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Sorry I never sent it back to you üòü
30/08/2018, 9:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Although (because of your comments) I've been told my CV is good now! üòÑ
30/08/2018, 9:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Who said it was good?
30/08/2018, 10:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Recruiters who have been calling me asking if I'm interested in their job
30/08/2018, 10:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Someone a bit more credible than "my mom said it was good" üòÜ
31/08/2018, 3:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha good!
31/08/2018, 3:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: What kind of jobs are you after then?
31/08/2018, 4:15 pm - Stephen Browett: Data science / analytics
31/08/2018, 4:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Which, as far as I can tell, is what I've been doing during my PhD but I just have to get analyses working rather than spending months faffing around with my supervisor asking stupid questions and then writing a paper
31/08/2018, 4:18 pm - Stephen Browett: üòù
31/08/2018, 4:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha I guess that‚Äôs true!
31/08/2018, 4:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Any luck yet?
31/08/2018, 4:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I have two interviews scheduled next week and 3 more people saying they're reporting a phone interview to their managers and going to get back to me
31/08/2018, 4:21 pm - Stephen Browett: So it's getting there!
31/08/2018, 4:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbh I really want to hear back from one job in particular but it's been about a month...
31/08/2018, 4:22 pm - Stephen Browett: I've been in contact with the recruiter who's said that the managers are busy and so haven't come to a decision yet
31/08/2018, 4:23 pm - Stephen Browett: But they need to hurry up otherwise I might be getting offers soon
31/08/2018, 4:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah that‚Äôs true but often they don‚Äôt et around to decide until you do have another offer
31/08/2018, 4:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs when they really need to make the decision
31/08/2018, 4:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: But you also need to decide if you want to be part of a company where they take this long to decide on something - I mean, you‚Äôre important to them! They should treat you with the biggest respect otherwise, why should you ensure they get their salary?
31/08/2018, 4:30 pm - Stephen Browett: That is a good point tbf and something I was thinking about yesterday...
31/08/2018, 4:31 pm - Stephen Browett: But the job sounds really good and is in a really nice location
31/08/2018, 4:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good place to work
31/08/2018, 4:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: You need to know your worth also
31/08/2018, 4:50 pm - Stephen Browett: True, maybe the recruiter doesn't have the heart to tell me I didn't get it and hopes I go away eventually üòù
31/08/2018, 4:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: Nah, that would be a waste of everyone‚Äôs time üòâ
31/08/2018, 4:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: They usually get an incentive for hiring someone so why should they bother keeping you on for a ‚Äúno go‚Äù?
31/08/2018, 6:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Because I'm great! üòÜ
31/08/2018, 6:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol, true
31/08/2018, 6:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: But not that great üòâ
31/08/2018, 6:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha don't let my ego get too big üòÖ
31/08/2018, 6:27 pm - Stephen Browett: One of the interviews I have next week wants me to put together a 10 minute presentation on how my existing skills apply to the business
31/08/2018, 6:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Makes sense but I'm not looking forward to it
31/08/2018, 6:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Having to explain my work with very little reference to the science is a new experience for me!
31/08/2018, 6:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah yes... I‚Äôve heard this has become the new norm of how to do interviews
31/08/2018, 6:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm not a big fan of it though, it‚Äôs better to have a conversation and let you tell it there
31/08/2018, 6:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: I guess they‚Äôre after that you know what you can contribute with and that it can be explained in words they understand
31/08/2018, 9:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, some people are good at guessing the answer you want to hear
31/08/2018, 9:26 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll probably start putting it together on Monday
02/09/2018, 7:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think I will move back to the UK
02/09/2018, 8:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Really?!!! üòÑ
02/09/2018, 8:22 pm - Stephen Browett: What's made your mind up?
02/09/2018, 10:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm tired of life and need a change üòõ
02/09/2018, 10:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: And all my friends are in the UK
02/09/2018, 11:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes I am! üòÑ
02/09/2018, 11:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I like that though, you fancy a change so you're going for it
03/09/2018, 3:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve been told off by too many people saying that I don‚Äôt live the life I deserve üòÖ so it‚Äôs not all on me, but I‚Äôm finally doing something about it
03/09/2018, 3:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve been thinking about it for two years now and I really should just do it
03/09/2018, 3:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I can always move back if it doesn‚Äôt suit me
03/09/2018, 4:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Those people sounds awful! Who's been saying that?
03/09/2018, 4:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Come over here, the British are much too polite to say anything like that üòù
03/09/2018, 4:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Where do you want to live?
03/09/2018, 4:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol, they all live in Britain üòÇ
03/09/2018, 4:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have a few places I‚Äôm looking: Cardiff, Bristol, Leeds and Edinburgh
03/09/2018, 4:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: But to be honest, I‚Äôll do anything as long as it pays well
03/09/2018, 4:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Unbelievable! Usually we're rude behind people's backs üòù
03/09/2018, 4:47 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm sure it won't take you long to find something with your experience üòÑ
03/09/2018, 4:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha that‚Äôs true but I guess this was a special case
03/09/2018, 4:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah, I don‚Äôt know... I‚Äôm picky and I guess I go for jobs out of my league
03/09/2018, 4:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: I am tempted to hand in my resignation tomorrow and if I haven‚Äôt got a job within three months, just move and crash on someone‚Äôs sofa while searching for a job
03/09/2018, 4:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: By that time I‚Äôll take ‚Äúanything‚Äù and can work my way up
03/09/2018, 4:52 pm - Stephen Browett: If you don't aim up you'll never hit the targets that are out of reach
03/09/2018, 4:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: That is very true
03/09/2018, 4:53 pm - Stephen Browett: That definitely sounds like something you'd read on a motivational cat poster üò∏
03/09/2018, 4:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: You should make one!
03/09/2018, 5:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha start selling it? I'd make millions!
03/09/2018, 5:01 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll share my earnings with you so you can quit üòù
03/09/2018, 5:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect!!
03/09/2018, 5:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs much better
03/09/2018, 5:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: We could travel the world!
03/09/2018, 5:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes!! Let's do Thailand üáπüá≠
03/09/2018, 5:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha, why Thailand?
03/09/2018, 5:26 pm - Stephen Browett: It looks pretty üòÜ
03/09/2018, 5:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: True but so does Jamaica
04/09/2018, 12:33 am - Stephen Browett: Ooh Jamaica would be cool! üòé
04/09/2018, 12:34 am - Stephen Browett: We could get high on the beach and listen to some reggae üòù
04/09/2018, 6:00 am - Solveig Andvig: Livin‚Äô life üòé
04/09/2018, 6:37 am - Solveig Andvig: May I ask what recruitment company you‚Äôre using?
04/09/2018, 6:37 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm not sure but I would imagine it‚Äôs easier to get an interview from overseas through one
04/09/2018, 10:06 am - Stephen Browett: I'm applying through job ads placed on websites which go through different recruiters
04/09/2018, 10:07 am - Stephen Browett: Www.totaljobs.co.uk is quite a good site
04/09/2018, 10:20 am - Solveig Andvig: Ahh I see
04/09/2018, 10:20 am - Solveig Andvig: Thanks! I‚Äôll have a look
04/09/2018, 10:20 am - Solveig Andvig: So are you still based on Southampton?
04/09/2018, 10:42 am - Stephen Browett: No, I'm based near Birmingham now
04/09/2018, 10:43 am - Stephen Browett: Eyeing up where you have sofas to crash on? üòù
04/09/2018, 10:58 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes!
04/09/2018, 12:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: How come you‚Äôve moved?
04/09/2018, 12:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't have to pay rent at my parents house üòÜ
04/09/2018, 1:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha! So you‚Äôve moved home again?
04/09/2018, 1:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Does holly live with you?
04/09/2018, 1:53 pm - Stephen Browett: No, she lives at her parents house in Leicester (about an hour down the road)
04/09/2018, 1:54 pm - Stephen Browett: And yes I have moved home, honestly best thing I could have done after finishing to relax
04/09/2018, 2:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, I get that
04/09/2018, 2:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: So are you going to get a job in Birmingham?
04/09/2018, 2:30 pm - Stephen Browett: It looks like I will, I've applied for jobs in a few locations but I've only had interest from places in Birmingham
04/09/2018, 2:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Or near Birmingham at least
04/09/2018, 2:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: I haven‚Äôt had any interest yet! I suspect it‚Äôs because I live abroad so they see it as a disadvantage
04/09/2018, 2:57 pm - Stephen Browett: They might think you'll want relocation costs covered or something? You could try contacting the recruitment agencies directly to explain your situation?
04/09/2018, 3:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah I‚Äôll do that!
04/09/2018, 3:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: I haven‚Äôt had my heart in it just yet because there‚Äôs been a lot going on at the moment but now I need to start acting on things
04/09/2018, 3:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs taken me 6 years to get my motivation back after my dad died!
04/09/2018, 4:55 pm - Stephen Browett: That's alright! Sounds like you're ready to hit the ground running üòÑ
04/09/2018, 4:56 pm - Stephen Browett: You were always the most motivated person I knew at uni so if you're saying you're going to be pushing yourself from now on anyone would be luck to have you
04/09/2018, 4:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Just make sure you don't apply to anything I'm interested in, I don't fancy the competition üòù
04/09/2018, 5:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol! I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem
04/09/2018, 5:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Of course you wouldn't, but I do haha
04/09/2018, 5:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: But I wouldn‚Äôt have a chance in the types of jobs you apply for because I haven‚Äôt used that knowledge for a long time
04/09/2018, 5:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: So in that sense you wouldn‚Äôt have any competition with me
04/09/2018, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Btw, I‚Äôm fed up with work now. I have told them for a month now that I have too much work and can‚Äôt get it all done but they don‚Äôt seem to care and now I‚Äôm late to my mothers birthday celebration because I had to try and finalise something before... and I was only half done when I left now
04/09/2018, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know I recommended it and I think it‚Äôs getting better but I have just seen all the struggles and bad sides of it all so I have no sympathy left
04/09/2018, 5:08 pm - Stephen Browett: You definitely made the correct decision to go home
04/09/2018, 5:08 pm - Stephen Browett: If you've made them aware that there is too much work and they've done nothing then that's on them
04/09/2018, 5:08 pm - Stephen Browett: Happy birthday to your mom btw üòÑ
04/09/2018, 5:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh it was a week ago but I was away with work! Ha ha
04/09/2018, 5:38 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha well I hope she had a good one!
04/09/2018, 5:39 pm - Stephen Browett: How big is the party this evening btw?
04/09/2018, 5:39 pm - Stephen Browett: Is your mom throwing a wild one?
04/09/2018, 5:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha no
04/09/2018, 5:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs my gran, my mother and myself
04/09/2018, 5:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Maybe when she turns 60
04/09/2018, 8:25 pm - Stephen Browett: I bet she's got a wild party story or two üòù
04/09/2018, 8:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve never heard any!
04/09/2018, 8:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: And when she tries to tell a wild story they‚Äôre not particularly wild... hahaha
04/09/2018, 8:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha she just doesn't want to tell you üòù
04/09/2018, 8:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Or you need to show her how it's done!
04/09/2018, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha I could but she wouldn‚Äôt survive
04/09/2018, 9:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs nice that you‚Äôre finally replying I messages!
04/09/2018, 9:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: You must be bored at home
04/09/2018, 9:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha replying to messages is a nice distraction from endlessly preparing for job interviews üòÖ
04/09/2018, 9:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Tell me about it...
04/09/2018, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here but I've got a telephone interview tomorrow them I have interviews in Birmingham on Thursday and London on Friday
04/09/2018, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm starting to think I can't be arsed with employment üòÇ
04/09/2018, 10:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs good though!
04/09/2018, 10:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: I also have an interview tomorrow in Oslo actually
04/09/2018, 10:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: But I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll take the role of offered...
04/09/2018, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: What role is it?
04/09/2018, 10:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Bid manager
04/09/2018, 10:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Is that putting bids together to win contracts?
05/09/2018, 5:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah üòä
05/09/2018, 10:58 pm - Stephen Browett: My dad does some of that in his job
05/09/2018, 10:59 pm - Stephen Browett: He was telling me how annoying the client can be during the presentation that goes along with the bid üòÜ
06/09/2018, 3:46 am - Solveig Andvig: Annoying how?
06/09/2018, 11:44 am - Stephen Browett: Well he had one client that told him that they will be timing the presentation but then proceeded to ask questions the whole way through and then said that they hadn't stuck to time... üòù
06/09/2018, 11:50 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol, yes that could of course happen
06/09/2018, 11:03 pm - Stephen Browett: How did your interview in Oslo go btw?
07/09/2018, 5:44 am - Solveig Andvig: It went well - I think they want to hire me but my gut feeling about it is not right even though it would represent everything I want
07/09/2018, 6:19 am - Stephen Browett: On paper it ticks all of the right boxes but in reality you're not so sure?
07/09/2018, 6:21 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah kind of
07/09/2018, 6:21 am - Solveig Andvig: I just get a feeling that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not right for me and I think I should listen to that
07/09/2018, 7:03 am - Stephen Browett: Definitely, if your heart is not in it then you'd just be wasting your time
07/09/2018, 7:03 am - Stephen Browett: Come to the UK! üòÑ
07/09/2018, 7:09 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm very tempted to do that
07/09/2018, 7:09 am - Solveig Andvig: To be honest I want to just hand in my resignation and sell my flat, save the last three months I‚Äôm working in kongsberg and then move to the UK
07/09/2018, 7:10 am - Solveig Andvig: Hopefully I already have a job then but otherwise I need will start applying for jobs then
07/09/2018, 7:10 am - Solveig Andvig: The money from selling the flat should be enough to survive for a year but then I‚Äôd have less savings üò¨
07/09/2018, 7:11 am - Solveig Andvig: But I‚Äôm not sure how easy it is to be allowed to work in the UK...
07/09/2018, 7:11 am - Solveig Andvig: What if your country doesn‚Äôt want me? üòÖ
07/09/2018, 7:19 am - Stephen Browett: Then it's a stupid country!
07/09/2018, 7:20 am - Stephen Browett: There are a few visas that you can apply for but I'm not sure about what exactly the conditions of each are
07/09/2018, 7:22 am - Stephen Browett: Although if you can get a company to take you on then there is a "right to work" visa if you can prove that you are better than any of the English applicants
07/09/2018, 7:23 am - Stephen Browett: And do you really have a 3 month notice period?!
07/09/2018, 7:23 am - Stephen Browett: That seems super long
07/09/2018, 7:23 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah it‚Äôs standard here
07/09/2018, 7:24 am - Solveig Andvig: And I don‚Äôt really need a work visa until brexit happens because we‚Äôre in the economic agreement thing
07/09/2018, 7:24 am - Solveig Andvig: When do you think you‚Äôll have brexit? üòÖ
07/09/2018, 7:27 am - Stephen Browett: Errrrm... üòù
07/09/2018, 7:27 am - Stephen Browett: I think we officially leave in March next yesr
07/09/2018, 7:28 am - Stephen Browett: Unless there's been another extension
07/09/2018, 7:29 am - Stephen Browett: Plus the pound is hardly worth anything so that must help you out üòÖ
07/09/2018, 7:30 am - Solveig Andvig: If I have a Norwegian salary it does!
07/09/2018, 7:30 am - Solveig Andvig: Ok so I may just about get a job there before brexit is supposed to happen... that‚Äôs good
07/09/2018, 7:30 am - Solveig Andvig: How come you‚Äôre up so early?
07/09/2018, 7:32 am - Stephen Browett: I have an interview in London at 11am
07/09/2018, 7:32 am - Solveig Andvig: Cool! Do you feel prepared?
07/09/2018, 7:33 am - Stephen Browett: Reasonably
07/09/2018, 7:33 am - Stephen Browett: I'm a bit nervous because I don't think I did very well on the phone interview
07/09/2018, 7:33 am - Stephen Browett: So I want to be at my best
07/09/2018, 7:33 am - Stephen Browett: Just a bit of pressure üòù
07/09/2018, 7:34 am - Solveig Andvig: Well if they are still letting you use their time out of a busy day then I‚Äôm sure you did better than you think!
07/09/2018, 7:34 am - Solveig Andvig: Don‚Äôt underestimate these important signals
07/09/2018, 7:35 am - Solveig Andvig: Time is precious so if you get time then they‚Äôre interested
07/09/2018, 7:35 am - Solveig Andvig: And it‚Äôs always easier to make a lasting impression in person so good luck!
07/09/2018, 7:35 am - Solveig Andvig: What jobs position is it?
07/09/2018, 7:37 am - Stephen Browett: It's quite a varied role so the job title is quite loosely defined
07/09/2018, 7:37 am - Stephen Browett: It's basically a data scientist job with a startup that are opening offices in Birmingham
07/09/2018, 7:37 am - Solveig Andvig: Nice
07/09/2018, 7:37 am - Solveig Andvig: That should be interesting!
07/09/2018, 7:38 am - Solveig Andvig: They don‚Äôt happen to need a project manager also? üòõ
07/09/2018, 7:48 am - Stephen Browett: Haha I'll see if they mention anything üòÑ
07/09/2018, 7:49 am - Stephen Browett: If I get the job I'll put in a good word for you
07/09/2018, 8:08 am - Solveig Andvig: I hope so üòÅ
07/09/2018, 9:38 am - Solveig Andvig: You will have to let me know how it goes!
07/09/2018, 9:51 am - Stephen Browett: Will do, I'm expecting it to be about an hour or two then go for lunch so hopefully I'll be done by 1pm latest
07/09/2018, 1:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sooo, how did it go??
07/09/2018, 1:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Just got out, I think it went really well! üòÑ
07/09/2018, 1:35 pm - Stephen Browett: It was a bit of a brainstorming session on some real problems they're trying to address and I came up with a couple of potential solutions for them
07/09/2018, 1:36 pm - Stephen Browett: So hopefully they're impressed with that!
07/09/2018, 1:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect!
07/09/2018, 1:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs a long session also
07/09/2018, 1:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Will you be working in Birmingham or London?
07/09/2018, 1:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Well, it was an hour and a half, I got some lunch before messaging you üòù
07/09/2018, 1:56 pm - Stephen Browett: The job is based in Birmingham
07/09/2018, 1:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Greatest city on earth
07/09/2018, 1:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
07/09/2018, 2:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hah! I have mixed feelings about Birmingham
07/09/2018, 2:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Its scariest place I‚Äôve been in the UK but maybe I was in the wrong place at the wrong time lol
07/09/2018, 2:37 pm - Stephen Browett: What happened?
07/09/2018, 2:37 pm - Stephen Browett: If this was on a night out then there is definitely a chance you could have been stabbed...
07/09/2018, 2:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes night out
07/09/2018, 2:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: And if we had followed mcbains suggestion we would either have been stabbed or been the first people at the scene of a stabbing
07/09/2018, 2:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòß
07/09/2018, 2:46 pm - Stephen Browett: What was mcbains suggestion? This sounds like a night of bad decisions!
07/09/2018, 3:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha it definitely was!
07/09/2018, 3:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: He had warned us of two things: 1) do not walk home because people get stabbed and robbed, 2) do not take the night bus because people get stabbed on a weekly basis, 3) do not take a pirate taxi because they will rob you
07/09/2018, 3:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: So this was when he was sober, so we decided to take a normal taxi home.
07/09/2018, 3:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: However, at the end of the night he had spent all his money and decided we should walk home instead but the rest of us insisted on taking a taxi so we got home safe
07/09/2018, 3:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: The morning after he came in and told us it was a good thing we didn‚Äôt walk because someone had been stabbed along that road around the time we would have been there if we walked
07/09/2018, 3:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: So yeah...
07/09/2018, 3:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÖ
07/09/2018, 3:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know a lot of decent people from the area but I‚Äôve only heard bad stories!
07/09/2018, 3:31 pm - Stephen Browett: Yay Birmingham! üòÖ
07/09/2018, 3:32 pm - Stephen Browett: That is the standard comment, that you'll get stabbed and robbed
07/09/2018, 3:32 pm - Stephen Browett: But the stereotype exists for a reason I guess!
07/09/2018, 3:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbh I've never been out in brum so I may have a skewed view of the area üòù
07/09/2018, 3:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: The thing is that Norway is so safe that just someone talking about this as being normal makes me scared
07/09/2018, 3:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò®
07/09/2018, 3:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Well Britain has the highest rate of knife crime in the world (I think)
07/09/2018, 3:49 pm - Stephen Browett: But that's mostly because we don't allow guns and other countries do (that have generally much higher crime rates)
07/09/2018, 3:49 pm - Stephen Browett: So the statistic is a bit skewed
07/09/2018, 3:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ugh
07/09/2018, 3:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Don‚Äôt scare me from moving now ü§≠
07/09/2018, 3:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha tbf you'll be able to live in a nice area where it is safe anyway
07/09/2018, 3:58 pm - Stephen Browett: So I will be seeing you soon üòù
07/09/2018, 3:58 pm - Stephen Browett: You don't get a choice haha
07/09/2018, 3:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs good üòÅ
07/09/2018, 3:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm conflicted as to where I should go
07/09/2018, 3:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: Like which city
07/09/2018, 4:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: I love the ocean but most of the places where people live there‚Äôs only a river
07/09/2018, 4:01 pm - Stephen Browett: True, the cities next to the sea are port cities as well so you won't get a beach or anything like that
07/09/2018, 4:01 pm - Stephen Browett: But Britain is so small that a day trip out to the seaside or a weekend away is always do-able
07/09/2018, 4:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: True!
07/09/2018, 4:03 pm - Stephen Browett: You can do the classic British weekend at weston super-mare!
07/09/2018, 4:03 pm - Stephen Browett: (it's a bit naff, don't do it)
07/09/2018, 4:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Never heard of it?
07/09/2018, 4:32 pm - Stephen Browett: It's a tacky seaside resort that was popular in the 80s
07/09/2018, 4:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Don't worry about it haha üòÇ
07/09/2018, 4:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah! I‚Äôll google it
07/09/2018, 4:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Looks like Any seaside town
07/09/2018, 4:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha it's not too bad really but there are definitely nicer places to go
07/09/2018, 4:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Always!
07/09/2018, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: We could do a "visit somewhere new" trip every so often!
07/09/2018, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: That would be awesome!
07/09/2018, 4:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes! üòÅ
07/09/2018, 4:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you have a car?
07/09/2018, 4:38 pm - Stephen Browett: Bought one literally two days ago! üòÑ
07/09/2018, 4:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Wow! Congrats üëèüèº
07/09/2018, 4:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: Picture?
07/09/2018, 5:44 pm - Stephen Browett: I haven't taken any yet because we're having the boiler replaced and the car is surrounded by plumbing vans üòÜ
07/09/2018, 5:45 pm - Stephen Browett: https://goo.gl/images/sBRB6c
07/09/2018, 5:45 pm - Stephen Browett: It looks like that but with black wheels
07/09/2018, 5:46 pm - Stephen Browett: You're not allowed to say anything bad about it üòù
07/09/2018, 5:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Volvo!
07/09/2018, 5:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good car üòÅüëåüèº
07/09/2018, 6:04 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm surprised you're so keen on a Swedish car! üòù
07/09/2018, 6:05 pm - Stephen Browett: But it is a great car
07/09/2018, 6:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs a good brand
07/09/2018, 6:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: But it‚Äôs not Swedish owned anymore
07/09/2018, 7:15 pm - Stephen Browett: Are they not? I know their wrre owned by Ford when my car was built
07/09/2018, 10:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think the Japanese bought it?
08/09/2018, 10:25 am - Stephen Browett: Just googled it, the Chinese own volvo now
08/09/2018, 10:26 am - Stephen Browett: Volvo is listed as a "luxury car" brand apparently üòù
08/09/2018, 10:26 am - Solveig Andvig: Well it is!
08/09/2018, 11:02 am - Stephen Browett: Haha sorry, I'm just mega happy with it üòÖ
08/09/2018, 11:10 am - Stephen Browett: How was your mom's party the other day btw?
08/09/2018, 11:11 am - Solveig Andvig: It was ok, we just went out for dinner üòä
08/09/2018, 11:38 am - Stephen Browett: Sounds alright! Somewhere nice?
08/09/2018, 11:38 am - Solveig Andvig: Usually but they had changed the menu and the waiter stinked of cigarette smoke so I wasn‚Äôt too impressed this time
08/09/2018, 11:39 am - Solveig Andvig: Doing anything fun this weekend?
08/09/2018, 11:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Well we got the boiler replaced... üòù
08/09/2018, 11:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Went out to dinner tonight with friends and I might go to a country festival tomorrow
09/09/2018, 7:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
09/09/2018, 7:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÇüòÇ
09/09/2018, 7:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: We need a night out like this!
09/09/2018, 9:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: How‚Äôs the planning of the reunions going btw?
10/09/2018, 4:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Steeeeeve, don‚Äôt ignore me!
10/09/2018, 5:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Sorry! üòù
10/09/2018, 5:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha which person would you want to be in this picture? üòÇ
10/09/2018, 5:31 pm - Stephen Browett: And I was wondering about November for an Aber reunion? There will be students about and the nights will get dark early enough for us to be able to not feel guilty if we get drunk by 8pm üòù
10/09/2018, 5:31 pm - Stephen Browett: What do you reckon?
10/09/2018, 5:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôd be the one carrying! üí™üèº
10/09/2018, 5:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah November could be fun!
10/09/2018, 5:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: I haven‚Äôt had a proper night out in ages so I‚Äôll probably get drunk
10/09/2018, 6:22 pm - Stephen Browett: As long as you're not too drunk to carry me home üòÜ
10/09/2018, 6:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah! That would be a story for the books!
10/09/2018, 6:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Luckily it‚Äôs not that far to carry you... and mostly downhill
10/09/2018, 6:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha now we just need to source a bucket with a handle that fits around my head üòÜ
10/09/2018, 6:51 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll check out the availability of Mark's place tonight!
10/09/2018, 6:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect üòÅüëåüèº
10/09/2018, 7:13 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm just looking at suits atm for the new job I start in 2 weeks üòÑ
10/09/2018, 7:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: What, you got the job??? üòÑüòÑ
10/09/2018, 7:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: The data analysis thing?
10/09/2018, 7:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Yep! üòÑ
10/09/2018, 7:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ahh congrats!! That‚Äôs amazing üéâ
10/09/2018, 7:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Thank you üòÖ
10/09/2018, 7:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs the one based in Birmingham? Will holly come and live with you?
10/09/2018, 7:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, it's in Birmingham but I'll be down in London occasionally at the head office
10/09/2018, 7:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Holly won't come and live with me until she finds herself a job
10/09/2018, 7:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: Cool üòä again, if they need a project manager or a rookie analyst then hit me up üòÖ
10/09/2018, 7:20 pm - Stephen Browett: As I'm going to stay with parents for a while to save for a house deposit üòÑ
10/09/2018, 7:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah, right!
10/09/2018, 7:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôre growing up Steve
10/09/2018, 7:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha it's moving too fast! üòù
10/09/2018, 7:20 pm - Stephen Browett: And I'll keep an eye out for any manager roles for you
10/09/2018, 7:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Rookie analyst eh? Fancy yourself a bit of data analysis?
10/09/2018, 7:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: To be honest, I‚Äôll probably enjoy the technical work more, but because of my recent experience it‚Äôs difficult to get one
10/09/2018, 7:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: It would take some time to get back in the game üò¨
10/09/2018, 7:30 pm - Stephen Browett: That's OK, you can put together a skills based CV and see what fits
10/09/2018, 7:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm a little rusty when it comes to CVs but is this a different kind than the normal one?
10/09/2018, 8:26 pm - Stephen Browett: A little bit, you have a section at the start of your CV that lists your specific data analysis skills
10/09/2018, 8:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Plus I definitely found that there are certain skills the industry is looking for
10/09/2018, 8:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ahh yes, true
10/09/2018, 8:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Which ones are they after? üòÅ
10/09/2018, 9:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Well, definitely python coding, a lot of people want you to be familiar with machine learning techniques so experience of working with the "tensorflow" within python, also some data visualisation techniques such as using matplotlib (within python) or a program called "tableau" which is a bit quicker than using matplotlib
10/09/2018, 9:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Then you'll need specific skills such as time series analysis or geospatial data analysis
10/09/2018, 9:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Ooh and data cleaning! Everyone asks for that
11/09/2018, 8:58 am - Solveig Andvig: I don‚Äôt know what most of these things are üòÇ
11/09/2018, 8:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha well you've got a 3 month notice period so you can take some courses on skillshare or something üòÜ
11/09/2018, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòß
11/09/2018, 8:36 pm - Stephen Browett: In case you didn't have enough to do already üòÖ
11/09/2018, 8:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha exactly!
11/09/2018, 9:31 pm - Stephen Browett: What's the plan to emigrate over here btw?
11/09/2018, 9:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ha, well people say I‚Äôm crazy
11/09/2018, 9:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm quitting my job and hoping to land a job before I move otherwise I‚Äôll move and see if I can find a place I live while searching for a job
11/09/2018, 9:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbf if you're going to do it you've got to take the plunge! I think that's a brilliant idea üòÑ
11/09/2018, 9:34 pm - Stephen Browett: No point in faffing around with it
11/09/2018, 9:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: My biggest worry is having a place to stay
11/09/2018, 9:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: I will have money to live off for a while
11/09/2018, 9:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: But I can‚Äôt sign up to a flat for a year or anything until I know what‚Äôs going to happen
11/09/2018, 9:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Good point, there are short term lets of course which you can get for a month or so
11/09/2018, 9:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Plus, you know heaps of people who will have spare rooms for you
11/09/2018, 9:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Maybe.. but I don‚Äôt want to be a bother!
11/09/2018, 9:41 pm - Stephen Browett: People would love to have you around!
11/09/2018, 9:41 pm - Stephen Browett: If I had a spare room I'd offer!
11/09/2018, 9:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs kind üòä
11/09/2018, 9:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not everyone‚Äôs as kind as you though üòâ
11/09/2018, 9:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: But it‚Äôs a problem for the future! I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll manage and hopefully it won‚Äôt be for too long!
11/09/2018, 9:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve had mixed feelings this week though... I also feel very scared but I guess that‚Äôs good
11/09/2018, 9:42 pm - Stephen Browett: The first step is definitely finding the job!
11/09/2018, 9:43 pm - Stephen Browett: And it's the nerves that will make sure you get everything sorted out
11/09/2018, 9:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah... if anyone will have me
11/09/2018, 9:43 pm - Stephen Browett: You have 'the fear'
11/09/2018, 9:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: I do!
11/09/2018, 9:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: And it‚Äôs kept me where I am for 2 years now instead of following my heart
11/09/2018, 9:44 pm - Stephen Browett: People will definitely have you, you just need to apply!
11/09/2018, 9:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have applied to loads of jobs üòì
11/09/2018, 9:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: What I find difficult is that there are mostly recruiters on these job sites and it‚Äôs difficult to get through when someone who is guessing what someone needs is assessing your qualifications
11/09/2018, 9:51 pm - Stephen Browett: True but the recruiters are also prepared to do the leg work to find you something more suited
11/09/2018, 9:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah but how can they find something I‚Äôm more suited to without having spoken to me?
11/09/2018, 9:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: There‚Äôs a lot I know and can do which is not in my CV
11/09/2018, 9:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Like what? Should it be on there then?
11/09/2018, 9:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not really, they don‚Äôt know anything about how I perform my tasks and what kind of person I am based on my experience
11/09/2018, 9:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also, they don‚Äôt the real meaning of the points I‚Äôm listing
11/09/2018, 9:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: The projects are complex and I‚Äôve had a senior role for a few years without being able to call myself a senior
11/09/2018, 9:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: All they see is ‚Äú3 years of experience‚Äù
11/09/2018, 9:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Aah, I see
11/09/2018, 9:58 pm - Stephen Browett: As soon as a company calls you in for interview they're going to realise how lucky they are when they start speaking to you
11/09/2018, 9:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: Obviously üòâ
11/09/2018, 9:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: But it‚Äôs the ‚Äúgetting to the interview‚Äù which is difficult if these recruiters keep filtering me out
11/09/2018, 9:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I also have great references but never get to use them
11/09/2018, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Well, one thing at a time haha
11/09/2018, 10:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÖ
11/09/2018, 10:02 pm - Stephen Browett: A lot of recruiters will list a telephone number on a job advert, maybe you could call one so you can explain your situation and see what advice they can give
11/09/2018, 10:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Some recruiters will be crappy but others might be good!
11/09/2018, 10:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah I was thinking that! Once I‚Äôve quit my job - officially haha
11/09/2018, 10:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha good plan! üòÑ
11/09/2018, 10:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: I expect a ‚Äúwelcome back‚Äù party though üòé
11/09/2018, 11:19 pm - Stephen Browett: 100%! That's the bit I'm looking forward to most üòù
12/09/2018, 11:58 am - Solveig Andvig: Interesting
12/09/2018, 11:58 am - Solveig Andvig: Did you have any recruiters trying to connect with you on LinkedIn?
12/09/2018, 3:20 pm - Stephen Browett: I had a few (about 4). Have you had some trying to add you?
12/09/2018, 3:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah a guy based in Durham because I applied to a job in Newcastle
12/09/2018, 3:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Most of the time I've found they message you a couple of times but ultimately don't do anything
12/09/2018, 3:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, that might be the case
12/09/2018, 4:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: I was just told by the recruiter that apparently it will be difficult to employ me because I have no UK experience? Is this a general attitude? I thought international experience would be welcomed and that since I studied I the UK I would show that I knew the culture etc? Thoughts?
12/09/2018, 4:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbh I have no idea what "UK experience" is? That might have just been a lazy recruiter who didn't want to figure out how visas work
12/09/2018, 4:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: I guess uk experience means having worked in the uk previously
12/09/2018, 4:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: I was a bit surprised by the response but he offered to send a CV template he means is going to help me more than the one I have so I‚Äôm intrigued to see what he means is more tailored to the UK market!
12/09/2018, 4:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: I mean, he‚Äôs supposedly he expert üòÖ
12/09/2018, 5:07 pm - Stephen Browett: But then I don't have any UK experience either üòÖ
12/09/2018, 5:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha! That‚Äôs true üòÖ
12/09/2018, 5:07 pm - Stephen Browett: I'd be interested to see this CV he's going to send over to you though
12/09/2018, 5:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sure - if he sends it!
12/09/2018, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol! In the meantime, while I am waiting to get a proper job I can be a dog walker üòÇüëèüèº
12/09/2018, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: If I walked a dog every day for 1 hour then I‚Äôd have enough for my rent
12/09/2018, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
12/09/2018, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: I mean, this is great!
12/09/2018, 5:43 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes! That sounds amazing! üòÑ
12/09/2018, 5:43 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll quit my new job to do that with you üòù
12/09/2018, 5:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yay! Come to Leeds also? We can hang out with James
12/09/2018, 5:46 pm - Stephen Browett: And Suhayl! This idea is getting better and better haha
12/09/2018, 5:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely! üëèüèº
12/09/2018, 5:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: Professional dog walkers üòé
12/09/2018, 5:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: To be honest, you won‚Äôt get rich, but you‚Äôll survive on it
12/09/2018, 5:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: Say you get 5 hours each week, then you can get 1500 each month which is enough to live off
12/09/2018, 5:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Definitely in the North!	Although I guess that is pre tax... We'd have to flat-share üòÑ
12/09/2018, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha true!
13/09/2018, 10:32 am - Solveig Andvig: Teach me how to not give a fuck about things?
13/09/2018, 10:38 am - Stephen Browett: What's happened?
13/09/2018, 10:39 am - Solveig Andvig: Fed up with work and want to stop caring üò¨
13/09/2018, 10:40 am - Solveig Andvig: I told them earlier this year that I can‚Äôt work extra hours because of the tablets I‚Äôm taking for my skin. They make me very tired and exhausted. So I‚Äôve reminded them about five times now, but the workload is still equivalent to two people working full time.
13/09/2018, 10:41 am - Solveig Andvig: The problem is that for all tasks, they are supporting a new customer so I can‚Äôt just ignore it but no one will give me the assistance I need to perform it!
13/09/2018, 10:41 am - Solveig Andvig: So now I‚Äôm angry and want to stop caring because they don‚Äôt deserve that
13/09/2018, 10:44 am - Stephen Browett: You can't carry on like that, you'll end up having a break down or something!
13/09/2018, 10:44 am - Stephen Browett: Tbf they probably won't do anything unless you start missing deadlines
13/09/2018, 10:44 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, I‚Äôm not going to continue.
13/09/2018, 10:45 am - Solveig Andvig: Ha, I‚Äôve missed deadlines for months now and they don‚Äôt care
13/09/2018, 10:45 am - Solveig Andvig: They don‚Äôt have enough people but still want to get everything done
13/09/2018, 10:45 am - Stephen Browett: Are there more people in the office that feel like you do?
13/09/2018, 10:46 am - Stephen Browett: Because that's definitely a management problem
13/09/2018, 10:46 am - Solveig Andvig: Yes but maybe not so extreme
13/09/2018, 10:46 am - Solveig Andvig: Yes, but they don‚Äôt see that themselves
13/09/2018, 10:46 am - Stephen Browett: Maybe you can get a few people together to make a group complaint?
13/09/2018, 10:46 am - Stephen Browett: That'd carry more weight for sure
13/09/2018, 10:46 am - Solveig Andvig: The only people to contact is the union
13/09/2018, 10:47 am - Stephen Browett: Could be worth a go?
13/09/2018, 10:47 am - Solveig Andvig: True
13/09/2018, 10:47 am - Stephen Browett: Also, have you handed in your notice?
13/09/2018, 10:47 am - Solveig Andvig: No I‚Äôm waiting for the salary raise the 20th then I‚Äôll hand it in
13/09/2018, 10:48 am - Stephen Browett: Haha nice!
13/09/2018, 10:48 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll get a few more thousand kr out of them and it won‚Äôt make a difference for the end date
13/09/2018, 10:48 am - Stephen Browett: Tbf you deserve all the money they can give you
13/09/2018, 10:48 am - Solveig Andvig: I do
13/09/2018, 10:48 am - Solveig Andvig: I deserve more than they have been giving me, I‚Äôm underpaid which is also why I won‚Äôt stay
13/09/2018, 11:08 am - Stephen Browett: You've got to know your own worth and sometimes that goes beyond the money
13/09/2018, 11:09 am - Solveig Andvig: Not sometimes; always üòâ
13/09/2018, 11:23 am - Stephen Browett: Haha I'm glad you feel that way because you'll almost certainly take a pay cut when you move to the UK üòÖ
13/09/2018, 12:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely!
13/09/2018, 12:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: But then taxes are cheaper and so are the living expenses
13/09/2018, 12:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: I just got out of an interview in Oslo
13/09/2018, 12:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Seems very interesting!
13/09/2018, 12:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Ooh! What's the job /company?
13/09/2018, 12:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Atea if you know it?
13/09/2018, 12:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs an IT company and I have applied for a bid manager position!
13/09/2018, 1:18 pm - Stephen Browett: I've just googled it, they've done some really interesting work!
13/09/2018, 1:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah üòä
13/09/2018, 1:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: He said I‚Äôd get a case to present at the next interview round with his own boss
13/09/2018, 1:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you think you're getting through to the next round?
13/09/2018, 1:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm already through to the next round üòâ
13/09/2018, 1:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll present it at the second interview
13/09/2018, 1:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have success with the interviews in Norway but not the ones in UK üò©
13/09/2018, 2:24 pm - Stephen Browett: That's still amazing! Haha
13/09/2018, 2:24 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you know what you're going to present?
13/09/2018, 2:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not yet üò¨
13/09/2018, 2:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: But it‚Äôs a case he knows how he would solve so the purpose of it is to show him how I think and solve problems
13/09/2018, 2:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: So it shouldn‚Äôt be scary or difficult in any way
13/09/2018, 2:28 pm - Stephen Browett: Sounds like what you're doing already! You could do this presentation in your sleep!
13/09/2018, 2:28 pm - Stephen Browett: If this is offered to you, would you take it?
13/09/2018, 2:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don‚Äôt know yet, I might
13/09/2018, 2:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: This is the 1% which makes me uncertain of the future üò±
13/09/2018, 2:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha the possibility of getting a good job in Norway?
13/09/2018, 2:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: A well paid job
13/09/2018, 2:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs rather expensive to live in Oslo so I‚Äôd need a higher salary than I was offered at the other place
13/09/2018, 2:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Has a salary not been advertised yet?
13/09/2018, 2:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Plus, it's not all about the money üòù
13/09/2018, 2:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not yet no!
13/09/2018, 2:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: The system here is different
13/09/2018, 3:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: So you get paid by how many years you‚Äôve worked and not the position you have
13/09/2018, 3:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Which is shit because I have more responsibility than most of my engineers but they get paid more than me
13/09/2018, 3:05 pm - Stephen Browett: That is rediculous! Someone with more responsibility (has more liability in case something goes wrong) should absolutely get paid more in proportion with the risk
13/09/2018, 3:05 pm - Stephen Browett: They better offer you loads of money otherwise come over here üòÜ
13/09/2018, 3:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: I agree, but that‚Äôs not how Norway works
13/09/2018, 3:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Another reason to go to the Uk!
13/09/2018, 3:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, exactly hahah
13/09/2018, 3:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: What do you consider a good salary in the UK though?
13/09/2018, 3:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Where should I aim with four years of professional work experience and 17 years of work experience in total üòõ
13/09/2018, 3:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh btw, I had the awkward meeting of a co worker at the train - again! ‚ÄúOh hey... yeah I‚Äôve been to Oslo... for ermm.... ‚Äú Norway is so small üò©
13/09/2018, 3:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha! Smooth üòù
13/09/2018, 3:18 pm - Stephen Browett: And it's difficult to say as I don't know anyone over here who does that as a job...
13/09/2018, 3:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Happened last time too hahah
13/09/2018, 3:18 pm - Stephen Browett: I'd have thought you'd be looking at about ¬£30,000, maybe more?
13/09/2018, 3:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò¨
13/09/2018, 3:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Well, if they still don't know why you're going to Oslo then you're clearly too good for them
13/09/2018, 3:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Is that a lot less than you're paid atm?
13/09/2018, 3:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Scratch that, some quick googling has suggested that a bid manager earns between ¬£35,000 - ¬£55,000
13/09/2018, 3:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Or more, dependent on experience
13/09/2018, 3:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect!
13/09/2018, 3:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I want to be somewhere between 40-50
13/09/2018, 3:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: With the UK tax 50 is probably close to where I am today
13/09/2018, 3:42 pm - Stephen Browett: You can support a whole family on 50 over here! Haha
13/09/2018, 4:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah but I pay double the tax here... so it‚Äôs not so luxurious üòõ
13/09/2018, 4:13 pm - Stephen Browett: You'll be living a life of luxury over here on a salary like that
13/09/2018, 4:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Cleopatra won't have anything on you üòÜ
13/09/2018, 4:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Which is what I‚Äôm worth üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
13/09/2018, 4:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha you do, darling! üßê
13/09/2018, 5:03 pm - Stephen Browett: You should do a CV like this
13/09/2018, 5:03 pm - Stephen Browett: https://mymodernmet.com/autocomplete-cv/
13/09/2018, 5:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol! I was joking with a guy in work that we should create half-true CVs and cover letters and see if we got a response üòÇ
13/09/2018, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Like: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm born in the zodiac sign of Capricorn which should tell you all about my personality.‚Äù
13/09/2018, 5:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hobbies: ‚ÄúI prepare corpses for funerals as a part time job because I don‚Äôt like other people‚Äôs opinions when I share my thoughts. They‚Äôre a good crowd. ‚Äù
14/09/2018, 3:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Come oooon, I was funny? üò©
14/09/2018, 4:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Too funny! I couldn't think of a witty comeback! üòÖ
14/09/2018, 4:11 pm - Solveig Andvig: Pfff üòí
14/09/2018, 4:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Don't "Pfff" my performance anxiety üòù
14/09/2018, 4:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: True, that just makes it worse! I‚Äôm a bad person. üòà
14/09/2018, 4:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I think it's worse that my whole plan was to make you feel guilty ü§≠
14/09/2018, 4:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don‚Äôt do guilty, there‚Äôs no point in lingering on the past; all you can do is change now so the future is different
14/09/2018, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha so you don't feel bad about being evil, you were just acknowledging it? üòÜ
14/09/2018, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Fair enough!
14/09/2018, 4:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely
14/09/2018, 4:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm fabulous and don‚Äôt want to change anything
14/09/2018, 4:44 pm - Stephen Browett: So you definitely wouldn't have any performance anxiety and would probably have sex on a rooftop? (I'm just going to combine those conversations as it was beginning to feel a little schizophrenic)
14/09/2018, 4:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÇ
14/09/2018, 4:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: That is true - why would I feel anxious other than getting arrested for it?
14/09/2018, 4:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: I like to have fun and test boundaries! How else should we know what we like and not?
14/09/2018, 4:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Well, what about the pictures people will take and post online?
14/09/2018, 4:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Having said that, your attitude is probably a lot healthier than mine haha
14/09/2018, 4:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well if they want to take pictures then I guess I should be flattered?
14/09/2018, 4:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: No one wants to photograph something they can‚Äôt stand watching
14/09/2018, 4:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve found that British people are a lot more restricted when it comes to sex and intimacy
14/09/2018, 4:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: If you think about it, it‚Äôs a very natural and lovely thing so why not express it when and where you want? (Wishing some boundaries of course! Should always show respect to other people)
14/09/2018, 4:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Besides, when we were kids we went out to do ‚Äúcrazy things‚Äù all the time but it was more climbing to the top of a tree and throw ourselves into the air to catch a branch to get down or something
14/09/2018, 4:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: What fun and crazy stuff do we do as adults?? Nothing!
14/09/2018, 5:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Well I played bingo with my nan the other night, that was pretty wild!
14/09/2018, 5:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol üòÇüëåüèº
14/09/2018, 5:18 pm - Stephen Browett: I do know what you mean and the crazy thing might be that I'm less shy than a lot of other people I know
14/09/2018, 5:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: There‚Äôs no reason to be shy üòä
14/09/2018, 10:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha easier said than done
14/09/2018, 10:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Plus, the way you're talking, you sound like you'd be up for getting a job in the adult filming industry üòù
14/09/2018, 10:06 pm - Stephen Browett: You'd earn good money there as well haha
14/09/2018, 10:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: How do you know it‚Äôs not? üòÇüòÇ
14/09/2018, 10:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha this sounds like a "you've got to try it to know" kind of thing
15/09/2018, 6:59 am - Solveig Andvig: ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
15/09/2018, 7:00 am - Solveig Andvig: I think adult films is taking all the fun out of it
15/09/2018, 11:12 am - Stephen Browett: How do you mean?
15/09/2018, 11:16 am - Solveig Andvig: Adult films / porn is not exactly promoting healthy sex üòõ it shows fake pleasure and is staged, so: no chemistry, no spontaneity, no intimacy, no play and fun
15/09/2018, 12:26 pm - Stephen Browett: I agree with that to a certain extent, certainly that porn does not promote a healthy body image
15/09/2018, 12:27 pm - Stephen Browett: But I think even though it's staged the actors can still show chemistry etc
15/09/2018, 12:28 pm - Stephen Browett: Although it feel weird to be defending the porn industry.... I've not been on this side of the fence before üòù
15/09/2018, 12:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Everyone can put on an act if they want to üòâ
15/09/2018, 1:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha this is starting to sound like you've faked it
15/09/2018, 1:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve never been in a porn film?! üòß
15/09/2018, 1:24 pm - Stephen Browett: I wasn't thinking that far üòÜ
15/09/2018, 1:25 pm - Stephen Browett: I was thinking more like pretending to be enjoying yourself in the moment even though you're not really feeling it
15/09/2018, 1:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
15/09/2018, 1:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm not doing myself any favours faking it! If someone‚Äôs not doing a good job then they need to know; how else can we get better? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
15/09/2018, 3:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm going to apply to a job in Glasgow! One of my friends from Durham works there and told me the position just opened and that I should apply; building physics simulation which basically means programming in C++/Fortan and knowing thermodynamics
15/09/2018, 3:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: That is something I should be able to do so I hope I get an interview at least üòä
15/09/2018, 4:56 pm - Stephen Browett: That sounds super interesting! What are the simulations simulating? üòÑ
15/09/2018, 4:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Some form of heat transfer thei this windows I think
15/09/2018, 5:02 pm - Stephen Browett: That sounds like it's super lucrative
15/09/2018, 5:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Has it got everything you want from a job or is it still early days?
15/09/2018, 5:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah I think so!
15/09/2018, 5:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: I hope it‚Äôs something I can do üòÅ
15/09/2018, 5:51 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm sure it is! üòÑ
15/09/2018, 5:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Learn some c++ and you already know some fortran and thermodynamics
15/09/2018, 5:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Your 'welcome to the UK' /congratulations on the new job present will be an undergrad physics textbook and a copy of "c++ for dummies" haha
15/09/2018, 6:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well I‚Äôve used C++ more than Fortran lately so that‚Äôs probably a safer bet!
15/09/2018, 6:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: And that sounds brilliant! Why don‚Äôt you send it over now? üòâ
16/09/2018, 1:31 am - Stephen Browett: Two reasons
16/09/2018, 1:31 am - Stephen Browett: First, I haven't bought it yet
16/09/2018, 1:32 am - Stephen Browett: Second, you don't have the job yet üòù
16/09/2018, 1:32 am - Solveig Andvig: üòê
16/09/2018, 1:32 am - Solveig Andvig: Valid reasons
16/09/2018, 1:32 am - Solveig Andvig: Why are you up so late??? Go to sleep!
16/09/2018, 1:33 am - Stephen Browett: You're up later than me! üòÇ
16/09/2018, 1:34 am - Solveig Andvig: Because I‚Äôm older üëµüèº
16/09/2018, 1:35 am - Stephen Browett: Haha it's Saturday night, I was out a a gig. You wouldn't know them... üòù
16/09/2018, 1:36 am - Solveig Andvig: Another valid reason
16/09/2018, 1:36 am - Solveig Andvig: How come you‚Äôre so sensible at this time of night after having been out?
16/09/2018, 1:36 am - Solveig Andvig: Not enough booze!
16/09/2018, 1:37 am - Stephen Browett: I might have hit the drunk stage of being super serious
16/09/2018, 1:37 am - Stephen Browett: One more beer and I'd be having a deep conversion with a stranger haha
16/09/2018, 1:38 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol! Don‚Äôt go there üòÇ
16/09/2018, 1:40 am - Stephen Browett: Haha that'd be too far
16/09/2018, 1:41 am - Stephen Browett: I've only had 3 or 4 pints, so not too bad
16/09/2018, 1:41 am - Stephen Browett: I've been sensible!
16/09/2018, 1:41 am - Solveig Andvig: And you reach that state after so little? When did you become a lightweight? ü§îü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
16/09/2018, 1:42 am - Stephen Browett: Since leaving Aber!
16/09/2018, 1:42 am - Solveig Andvig: üòÇ
16/09/2018, 1:42 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm the same
16/09/2018, 1:42 am - Stephen Browett: This is also why I'd be the person with the bucket over my head in the picture you sent and you'd be the one carrying me
16/09/2018, 1:43 am - Stephen Browett: We need a proper night out! That'd be so much fun! üòÑ
16/09/2018, 1:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Lucky me üòÖ
16/09/2018, 1:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely!
16/09/2018, 1:43 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm still waiting for the invitation to the new reunion
16/09/2018, 1:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Or any other excuse to meet up
16/09/2018, 1:45 am - Stephen Browett: Not everybody gets that honour!
16/09/2018, 1:46 am - Stephen Browett: And I'm still working on that reunion, there's a lot to do with only a weekend in Aber!
16/09/2018, 1:50 am - Solveig Andvig: Is there?
16/09/2018, 1:51 am - Solveig Andvig: We just need a weekend and a place to stay üòä
16/09/2018, 1:51 am - Solveig Andvig: The people will turn up, they follow the leader
16/09/2018, 1:55 am - Stephen Browett: Alright, I'll suggest a few weekends tomorrow! üòÑ
16/09/2018, 2:35 am - Solveig Andvig: Perfectüòé
18/09/2018, 7:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
19/09/2018, 3:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: #ignored #becomingahabit #üò©
19/09/2018, 3:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÜ
19/09/2018, 11:22 pm - Stephen Browett: I am the worst, I'm really sorry üòì
19/09/2018, 11:23 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm at a charity event atm where I use my skills as a data scientist to smash out a data project for a charity in a few days
19/09/2018, 11:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Along with about 70 other people l
19/09/2018, 11:24 pm - Stephen Browett: And I really need a trip üòÖ
19/09/2018, 11:26 pm - Stephen Browett: How about doing Aber on the 27-28th of October?
19/09/2018, 11:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Or, if that's too short notice for you then there's the 10-11th, 17-18th or 24-25th of November?
20/09/2018, 8:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Wow! What was the job other than being a data scientist?
20/09/2018, 8:44 am - Solveig Andvig: Ok, thanks for the dates! I‚Äôll have to check with work since I‚Äôm going to leave then they may tell me I can‚Äôt take time off... üò¨ but I‚Äôll let you know!
20/09/2018, 11:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Today I found out that the older a person is, it is more likely that they will have a lower income before filing for homelessness than younger people
20/09/2018, 11:03 pm - Stephen Browett: So the locations where the charity focuses their efforts should not be on average income alone
20/09/2018, 11:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Yay! üòÑ
20/09/2018, 11:03 pm - Stephen Browett: I did a thing! Haha
20/09/2018, 11:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha! Cool how did you do that?
20/09/2018, 11:07 pm - Stephen Browett: If you have any leave saved up then your work should honour it
20/09/2018, 11:09 pm - Stephen Browett: I basically averaged the age of people registered as being homeless in each local authority area and plotted that against the average reported income in those local authorities
20/09/2018, 11:10 pm - Stephen Browett: So it's very much "on average" but I think that the anti-correlation between the datasets is still significant
21/09/2018, 6:34 am - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs interesting though
21/09/2018, 6:34 am - Solveig Andvig: And you got all this from a charity??
21/09/2018, 6:35 am - Solveig Andvig: This is actually research for the field of social sciences / social geography!
21/09/2018, 6:35 am - Solveig Andvig: Publish a paper üòâ
21/09/2018, 12:45 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha and disgrace my good name?! üòÇ
21/09/2018, 1:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Pfff
21/09/2018, 1:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Any PR is good PR is what they say
23/09/2018, 8:37 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm still confused about how these job sites work... I haven‚Äôt had any replies and I‚Äôve sent my CV loads of places; places where I am obviously 1:1 with what they‚Äôre seeking, places where I want to work but am not 1:1, places where I can work but I‚Äôm over qualified in my own eyes, but maybe not theirs. Still, no response from anywhere. Did you take a more active role and called any of them or did they contact you? It‚Äôs just frustrating and making me nervous that I‚Äôll end up not having a job for several months üòÇ
23/09/2018, 9:49 am - Stephen Browett: It seemed to take the recruiters a little while to notice my CV at first but then they started calling me
23/09/2018, 9:50 am - Stephen Browett: You could absolutely start calling them though to see what they think?
23/09/2018, 9:50 am - Stephen Browett: And to make them hurry up üòÇ
23/09/2018, 9:52 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha ok! I‚Äôll try to be a bit more patient
23/09/2018, 12:15 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
23/09/2018, 12:16 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbf I bet you'd get a bunch of good information about what recruiters or compaines are looking for over here if you called them up
23/09/2018, 12:16 pm - Stephen Browett: Might not be a bad idea if you get a chance!
23/09/2018, 12:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: True
23/09/2018, 12:20 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't know how things might be different over here but at least you'd open communication üòù
23/09/2018, 12:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think being in the UK would probably make me more attractive too
23/09/2018, 12:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is it tomorrow you start work?
23/09/2018, 12:34 pm - Stephen Browett: It is! üò®
23/09/2018, 12:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Are you excited? üòÅ
23/09/2018, 2:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Terrified! Haha
23/09/2018, 2:22 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm having to buy shirts today
23/09/2018, 2:22 pm - Stephen Browett: There's nothing quite like leaving things to the last minute üòù
23/09/2018, 2:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôll be fine! üòä
23/09/2018, 2:24 pm - Stephen Browett: What did you have to do when you first started your job?
23/09/2018, 2:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Nothing other than drink coffee and meet people
23/09/2018, 2:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: Except I don‚Äôt drink coffee so I was an outcast
23/09/2018, 2:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh dear, me neither (tastes bitter and gross) üò∑
23/09/2018, 2:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Guess I'll have to get used to being an outcast üòÇ
23/09/2018, 3:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòâ
23/09/2018, 3:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs perfectly fine, they‚Äôll just think you‚Äôre a kid but that lets you get away with making mistakes too so it‚Äôs all good at this age
23/09/2018, 3:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: But honestly, you‚Äôll probably just meet lots of people and get used to how things work the first week
23/09/2018, 3:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Maybe get some tasks next week
23/09/2018, 4:08 pm - Stephen Browett: Sounds perfect! I'll get to play with my new macbook üòù
23/09/2018, 4:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: You get a MacBook? üòß
23/09/2018, 4:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: You need to fix me a job at this place too!
23/09/2018, 4:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'll see what openings they have
23/09/2018, 4:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good üò¨
25/09/2018, 9:50 am - Solveig Andvig: So how was your first day?
25/09/2018, 12:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Crazy! üòÑ
25/09/2018, 12:57 pm - Stephen Browett: I crashed out pretty much as soon as I got back to the hotel haha
25/09/2018, 12:59 pm - Stephen Browett: But it was really good
25/09/2018, 12:59 pm - Stephen Browett: And today I'm getting my hands on the actual product and having a play
25/09/2018, 1:01 pm - Stephen Browett: It's fun! And macbook are strange haha
25/09/2018, 2:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs good!
25/09/2018, 7:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Thanks üòÑ
25/09/2018, 7:10 pm - Stephen Browett: I had to have a chat with the chief technical officer today which was just a "what am I doing?" conversation üòù
25/09/2018, 7:11 pm - Stephen Browett: But on the upside I now know what I'm doing! üôÉ
25/09/2018, 7:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
25/09/2018, 7:11 pm - Stephen Browett: How have you been doing btw?
25/09/2018, 7:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Did you hand your notice in?
25/09/2018, 7:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: So what are you doing? üòõ
25/09/2018, 7:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve been better! I haven‚Äôt actually no... I‚Äôm on a sick leave at the moment. The stress at work made me ill üò¨
25/09/2018, 7:29 pm - Stephen Browett: That can definitely happen!
25/09/2018, 7:29 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you get better soon üòä
25/09/2018, 7:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Handing in your notice will definitely make for feel better haha
25/09/2018, 7:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: True!
25/09/2018, 7:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm desperate for a change...
27/09/2018, 7:41 am - Solveig Andvig: What are typical interview questions for the positions you‚Äôve been interviewing for?
27/09/2018, 7:42 am - Solveig Andvig: I guess it‚Äôs probably the same as in Norway but there may be a cultural difference I‚Äôm not aware of!
27/09/2018, 9:29 am - Stephen Browett: So remember that I've only had two interviews but the first thing that's asked is what I know about the company
27/09/2018, 9:29 am - Stephen Browett: So it's always worth making sure you've read the company website üòù
27/09/2018, 9:30 am - Stephen Browett: Then they usually go into details about the role and asking how that relates to your previous experience
27/09/2018, 9:43 am - Stephen Browett: There are some typical "tricky" questions such as  "give an example of a time when have you shown intuition"
27/09/2018, 9:43 am - Stephen Browett: Or sometimes the question can be totally off the wall with some thing like "if you were a fruit, which fruit would you be and why?"
27/09/2018, 9:43 am - Stephen Browett: Which is stupid üòù
27/09/2018, 9:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Uhmm? Haha what a stupid question!
27/09/2018, 9:44 am - Solveig Andvig: I hate those things, they would make me not want to work there
27/09/2018, 9:44 am - Stephen Browett: Haha I totally understand
27/09/2018, 9:44 am - Stephen Browett: I bet they're not too different to what you get in Norway though?
27/09/2018, 9:44 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve never encountered the last two questions!
27/09/2018, 9:45 am - Solveig Andvig: They typically ask why you‚Äôre motivated for the role and why they should choose you over others
27/09/2018, 9:45 am - Solveig Andvig: What you find annoying in work and what makes you inspired
27/09/2018, 9:45 am - Solveig Andvig: Strengths, weaknesses etc
27/09/2018, 9:45 am - Solveig Andvig: And often some form of challenge
27/09/2018, 9:47 am - Stephen Browett: The rest sounds very familiar but what sort of challenge?
27/09/2018, 9:47 am - Solveig Andvig: It depends
27/09/2018, 9:48 am - Solveig Andvig: So for the job I have now they thought the challenge was to convince them that I should get the job in English
27/09/2018, 9:48 am - Solveig Andvig: Which was simple because I had just moved back from the UK
27/09/2018, 9:48 am - Solveig Andvig: But everyone else freaked out
27/09/2018, 9:48 am - Solveig Andvig: Other times I get a task that they want my opinion on or to present something
27/09/2018, 5:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I bet you were laughing when they asked you to converse with them in English üòÇ
27/09/2018, 5:15 pm - Stephen Browett: I have definitely heard of the interviewers asking you about a specific task or problem  or to present something
27/09/2018, 5:16 pm - Stephen Browett: I got this job because I nailed a problem they'd been having
27/09/2018, 5:16 pm - Stephen Browett: That's something that an interview over here would probably ask you about!
27/09/2018, 5:16 pm - Stephen Browett: But you can manage that no problem! üòÑ
27/09/2018, 5:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha it‚Äôs good you have faith in me because I don‚Äôt!
27/09/2018, 9:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: So what kind of fruit are you? üòùüçéüçêüçäüçãüçåüçâüçáü•ùüçÖ
27/09/2018, 10:09 pm - Stephen Browett: You should have faith in yourself! I have always thought that you are smarter than me!
27/09/2018, 10:10 pm - Stephen Browett: I'd be a tomato because I like being that guy who has to bust out the pedantic comments like "tomatoes are a fruit, not a vegetable"
27/09/2018, 10:10 pm - Stephen Browett: üòù
28/09/2018, 8:26 am - Solveig Andvig: Besserwisser
28/09/2018, 8:26 am - Solveig Andvig: No one likes them Steve!
28/09/2018, 8:28 am - Solveig Andvig: But maybe if you don‚Äôt know the word you‚Äôre not one of them after all... just be warned... üòè
28/09/2018, 8:28 am - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
28/09/2018, 9:53 am - Stephen Browett: I only read the first two sentences in that picture and agree with them entirely
28/09/2018, 9:54 am - Stephen Browett: 1. That word is german
28/09/2018, 9:54 am - Stephen Browett: 2. Yes, I do know better üòÇ
28/09/2018, 11:02 am - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha!!
28/09/2018, 11:02 am - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
01/10/2018, 7:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: After having worked for a week, what is your experience?
01/10/2018, 10:07 pm - Stephen Browett: It's exciting working at a startup!
01/10/2018, 10:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Everything happens so quickly
01/10/2018, 10:07 pm - Stephen Browett: I like it üòÑ
01/10/2018, 10:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good! What are you making?
01/10/2018, 10:10 pm - Stephen Browett: At the moment I'm making problems for the developers üòÖ
01/10/2018, 10:11 pm - Stephen Browett: I've discovered that the app gets a bit confused outside London
01/10/2018, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha
01/10/2018, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: Isn‚Äôt that good though?
01/10/2018, 10:23 pm - Stephen Browett: They seem to be happy with what I'm doing üòÇ
01/10/2018, 10:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Thanks for asking though üòÑ
01/10/2018, 10:24 pm - Stephen Browett: No one else has üòÖ
01/10/2018, 10:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Really?? Most people are too busy with their boring lives to care about others
01/10/2018, 10:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha that's probably not too far off the mark
01/10/2018, 10:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Was everyone at your work excited about the bepi columbo news recently?
01/10/2018, 10:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: What do you mean?
01/10/2018, 10:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Just what you sent to me the other day that it's just reach its final construction phase
01/10/2018, 10:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ahh yes!
01/10/2018, 10:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: We‚Äôre very excited about the launch, though, if I heard right it will happen at night... which is shit üòÇ
02/10/2018, 11:01 am - Stephen Browett: Pfft that's rubbish
02/10/2018, 11:01 am - Stephen Browett: Is there any chance you'd get to go to the launch?
02/10/2018, 11:01 am - Stephen Browett: üòù
02/10/2018, 11:02 am - Stephen Browett: Can you take a +1?
02/10/2018, 11:02 am - Stephen Browett: üòÑ
02/10/2018, 1:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: No unfortunately I won‚Äôt be there üòî
02/10/2018, 4:51 pm - Stephen Browett: It was worth a go üòù
02/10/2018, 4:51 pm - Stephen Browett: 100% assumed you'd take me if you could go haha
02/10/2018, 4:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha! Of course
02/10/2018, 4:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: As long as you give me a job.... üôà
02/10/2018, 4:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha well there's an office manager job going at work üòù
02/10/2018, 4:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: What does the office manager doing?
02/10/2018, 4:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: Can‚Äôt be more challenging than project manager?
02/10/2018, 5:04 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm not sure if it'll be more of a developer role who can help out anybody or if it will be more of a liaising role within the company and with clients
02/10/2018, 5:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Probably the former
02/10/2018, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòü
03/10/2018, 9:35 am - Stephen Browett: üòü
03/10/2018, 9:35 am - Stephen Browett: How has the job search been going anyway?
03/10/2018, 9:36 am - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs difficult
03/10/2018, 9:41 am - Stephen Browett: Oh no, have you handed in your notice yet?
03/10/2018, 9:45 am - Solveig Andvig: Not yet no! I‚Äôm still on a sick leave
03/10/2018, 9:46 am - Solveig Andvig: I thought it‚Äôs better to try and recover a little before going ‚Äúall in‚Äù
03/10/2018, 9:47 am - Solveig Andvig: I have a second interview in Oslo tomorrow though
03/10/2018, 9:47 am - Solveig Andvig: And I‚Äôve applied for a software developer role in Glasgow
03/10/2018, 9:49 am - Solveig Andvig: And a technical project manager role in Edinburgh but I‚Äôm not too optimistic there now... the recruiter called me and seemed very interested but after having spoken to the company they wanted someone with more medical background and even though my CV was good they hadn‚Äôt discussed any other opportunities and I guess this recruiter won‚Äôt follow through on checking this either...
03/10/2018, 9:49 am - Solveig Andvig: But the company seemed like a really cool place to work!
03/10/2018, 9:50 am - Stephen Browett: That's both awesome and a shame lol
03/10/2018, 9:50 am - Stephen Browett: What did the company do?
03/10/2018, 9:51 am - Solveig Andvig: Anything and everything which is why I would fit so well in haha
03/10/2018, 9:51 am - Solveig Andvig: Engineering consultants
03/10/2018, 10:10 am - Stephen Browett: I bet that would be super good!
03/10/2018, 10:11 am - Stephen Browett: And what made you apply for a software developer role?
03/10/2018, 10:11 am - Stephen Browett: I'd find that too hard lol
03/10/2018, 10:12 am - Solveig Andvig: Why would that be too hard?
03/10/2018, 10:13 am - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs for a company that does building physics so I‚Äôll use thermodynamics to build a program that simulates the heat transfer I think
03/10/2018, 10:13 am - Solveig Andvig: And I like programming üòä
03/10/2018, 5:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Programming is fun but I always get self conscious whenever I give my code to other people haha
03/10/2018, 5:56 pm - Stephen Browett: And modelling heat transfer is a super useful industrial tool
03/10/2018, 5:56 pm - Stephen Browett: You'd get a job In any sector with experience in that!
03/10/2018, 5:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do üòÅ
03/10/2018, 5:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Take a step in the direction of becoming more employable
03/10/2018, 5:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well, I already am but no one understands what to do with me
03/10/2018, 6:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha you're too advanced!
03/10/2018, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòü
03/10/2018, 6:09 pm - Stephen Browett: You just need to find the people who do know what to do with you and you'll be in the money then! üòÑ
03/10/2018, 6:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Most of the things I want to do require a PhD even though I don‚Äôt understand why
03/10/2018, 6:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you feel wiser having done a PhD compared to a MSc?
03/10/2018, 6:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Personally I feel much more sure of myself and my abilities doing a PhD
03/10/2018, 6:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Mostly because I had plenty of time to try lots of different analysis techniques and the hnologies
03/10/2018, 6:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Technologies
03/10/2018, 6:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: But that means similar to having worked for the same duration with that kind of work, right?
03/10/2018, 6:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Probably, I'm not sure of the specific benefit of doing a PhD for 4 years compared to 4 years of working
03/10/2018, 6:14 pm - Stephen Browett: I think for me personally it was a chance to mature and become more employable
03/10/2018, 6:15 pm - Stephen Browett: If I'd come out with the MSc I definitely would have ended up doing something menial
03/10/2018, 6:15 pm - Stephen Browett: But now I know things! üòÑ
03/10/2018, 6:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha good!
03/10/2018, 6:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs the important thing
05/10/2018, 9:07 am - Stephen Browett: Why did you ask btw?
05/10/2018, 9:07 am - Stephen Browett: Tempted to do one?
05/10/2018, 9:26 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha! ... 2 days later and this question still hasn‚Äôt left his mind üôà
05/10/2018, 9:26 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve always wanted to do one but I can‚Äôt choose one thing to dedicate myself to for 3 full years.
05/10/2018, 9:27 am - Solveig Andvig: And I haven‚Äôt been able to see the real advantage of doing one other than getting to study something you find interesting for that long a time. And probably having to continue doing that for the rest of your life because you‚Äôve gone down a very niche road.
05/10/2018, 9:27 am - Solveig Andvig: But it‚Äôs better to get the opinion from someone who has already done it to put my thoughts into perspective because really I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about!
05/10/2018, 9:33 am - Stephen Browett: Haha and the only way to know is to do a PhD but if you discover that it's not for you then it's too late and you're stuck in one
05/10/2018, 9:34 am - Solveig Andvig: üòë
05/10/2018, 9:35 am - Stephen Browett: But you're only stuck doing the thing in your PhD if you stay in research afterwards, if you move into industry then they care more about the tools and techniques you used rather than what you found
09/10/2018, 2:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
09/10/2018, 5:51 pm - Stephen Browett: The matrix is a great film!
09/10/2018, 5:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Not going to lie, if be tempted to take the blue pill üòù
09/10/2018, 5:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Which would you take?
09/10/2018, 6:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: it feels like I've already taken the red one ü§™
09/10/2018, 6:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: and probably would choose that one if I could
09/10/2018, 7:44 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha is that because you can dodge bullets and like wearing black leather and sunglasses? üòù
09/10/2018, 7:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: yes, that's my fetish üòé
09/10/2018, 7:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha a bullet dodge fetish? üòù
09/10/2018, 7:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes - it‚Äôs not a fetish if it‚Äôs not weird
09/10/2018, 7:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/10/2018, 12:46 pm - Stephen Browett: So it's definitely a fetish then? üòù
11/10/2018, 1:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha no!
14/10/2018, 3:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
14/10/2018, 3:48 pm - Stephen Browett: That looks pretty fancy!
14/10/2018, 3:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Where were you?
15/10/2018, 5:07 am - Solveig Andvig: At a friends birthday party üòä
17/10/2018, 11:12 am - Solveig Andvig: None of my friends laugh at this and I think it‚Äôs hilarious
17/10/2018, 11:12 am - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
17/10/2018, 11:12 am - Solveig Andvig: A ‚Äúsausage‚Äù sausage!
17/10/2018, 4:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha ü§£
17/10/2018, 4:23 pm - Stephen Browett: It upsets me that me must have cut the skin at the tip to detach it from the other sausages üòÇ
17/10/2018, 4:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha yes!
17/10/2018, 4:24 pm - Stephen Browett: He just gave his sausage sausage a circumcision
17/10/2018, 4:25 pm - Stephen Browett: That is universally hilarious though, what's wrong with your friends? üòù
17/10/2018, 4:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don‚Äôt know!!
17/10/2018, 4:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good thing you found it funny though
17/10/2018, 4:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha if I hadn't would you start asking questions of yourself?
17/10/2018, 4:41 pm - Stephen Browett: You just asked your least mature friend didn't you?
17/10/2018, 4:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Well I'm proud to hold that title
17/10/2018, 4:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: No comment üòÇ
17/10/2018, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I just love how happy the guy holding it is üòÇ
17/10/2018, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: He knew he'd found something that will make him Internet famous
17/10/2018, 5:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Exactly
17/10/2018, 6:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Having said the, I've never known a guy to not be happy whilst holding 'it' üòù
17/10/2018, 6:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§î
17/10/2018, 6:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs our 7 year anniversary as friends on fb today!
17/10/2018, 6:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: I assume it‚Äôs the day we ended up doing that project together
17/10/2018, 6:21 pm - Stephen Browett: It must be! üòÑ
17/10/2018, 6:21 pm - Stephen Browett: We nailed that project!
17/10/2018, 6:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: We did üòÅ
17/10/2018, 6:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: Imagine that.. 7 years as friends üòµ
17/10/2018, 6:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Did Facebook do a video of us btw?
17/10/2018, 6:34 pm - Stephen Browett: I can't see one on mine
17/10/2018, 6:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: No... üòí
17/10/2018, 6:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: We deserve one though
17/10/2018, 6:46 pm - Stephen Browett: We do! We will also need some new pictures to go in one
17/10/2018, 6:46 pm - Stephen Browett: When are you coming to the UK? üòù
17/10/2018, 6:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Soon?
17/10/2018, 6:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Just need to book the travel!
17/10/2018, 9:41 pm - Stephen Browett: That'll be amazing! üòÑ
17/10/2018, 9:42 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm still planning on going to Norway, hopefully before you move to the UK (if you're still planning on doing that) üòÖ
17/10/2018, 9:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: When? üòÅ and yes I am
17/10/2018, 10:11 pm - Stephen Browett: It'll have to be in the new year now because I don't have enough leave at my new job
17/10/2018, 10:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò¨
17/10/2018, 10:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: Book tickets!
18/10/2018, 6:59 pm - Stephen Browett: I need to! Do you know roughly when you're thinking you'll move over here?
18/10/2018, 7:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: It depends if I get a job or not
18/10/2018, 9:29 pm - Stephen Browett: That makes sense, I was just wondering if you had a date by which you're aiming to have found a job by
18/10/2018, 9:30 pm - Stephen Browett: If I book some tickets for February will kongsberg look like a winter wonderland? üòù
18/10/2018, 9:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll know more by early November! üòä
18/10/2018, 9:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: And most likely yes but I don‚Äôt know, the weather has been bipolar the last few years
21/10/2018, 11:19 am - Stephen Browett: Have you also been applying for jobs in Norway?
21/10/2018, 11:22 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah! I have a job offer in Oslo actually
21/10/2018, 11:24 am - Stephen Browett: Ooh! Exciting!!!
21/10/2018, 11:24 am - Stephen Browett: What's the offer?
21/10/2018, 11:25 am - Solveig Andvig: Bid manager in an IT infrastructure organisation
21/10/2018, 11:26 am - Solveig Andvig: They‚Äôll probably also certify me as a PRINCE2 practitioner also which is good
21/10/2018, 11:26 am - Solveig Andvig: And I get to learn more about contracts and negotiations which I like
21/10/2018, 7:44 pm - Stephen Browett: I bet that's a good business to be in, and to get certified as well must be a huge perk!
21/10/2018, 7:44 pm - Stephen Browett: Are you going to take the offer?
21/10/2018, 7:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think I might because I‚Äôm not sure if they will take me through to the role I applied for in Glasgow; or if they are it will be some time from now and it would pay a lot less
21/10/2018, 8:02 pm - Stephen Browett: I know it's a tough decision
21/10/2018, 8:02 pm - Stephen Browett: But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
21/10/2018, 8:02 pm - Stephen Browett: And all that
21/10/2018, 8:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hmm.. I don‚Äôt know this saying; explain?
21/10/2018, 8:06 pm - Stephen Browett: The analogy is that the job offer you have is worth more than one (or two) that you may never get
21/10/2018, 8:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah! Yes that‚Äôs probably true
21/10/2018, 8:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Especially since I am desperate to get away from my current job
21/10/2018, 8:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Presumably you had an interview? Did you like the place?
21/10/2018, 8:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: I had two actually!
21/10/2018, 8:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: It seems like a good place to work and more professional than where I am currently which is good for the type of job that I am doing and will be doing.
21/10/2018, 8:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have wanted to work with bid management full time but my boss told me they wouldn‚Äôt let me because they didn‚Äôt have enough work to keep someone full time in that position. It‚Äôs all BS though, they just don‚Äôt see how much work is really required and that it delays all other work that is going on.
21/10/2018, 8:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: But trying to listen to my explanation of this was too much to ask.
21/10/2018, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: So this position I have applied for is as a bid manager in a group of 7 senior bid managers so I believe I will have the potential of becoming up to speed very quick and learn all the common fall pits as well as develop my negotiation skills üòÅ
21/10/2018, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh and they sell IT infrastructure stuff
21/10/2018, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think I already said that... sorry haha
21/10/2018, 8:22 pm - Stephen Browett: No worries, you're excited about it! That's definitely a good thing! üòÑ
21/10/2018, 8:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm excited to get an opportunity there!
21/10/2018, 8:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: I just hate my life right now and I think this might help me not hate it anymore
21/10/2018, 8:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: So that‚Äôs a reason to take it üòÖ

21/10/2018, 9:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Although you won't be over here üòî

22/10/2018, 7:03 am - Solveig Andvig: I just need to find a semi-reasonable place to live such that I have some money to travel for
22/10/2018, 3:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: How did it go today?
23/10/2018, 8:43 pm - Stephen Browett: It went really well thanks üòÑ

23/10/2018, 8:44 pm - Stephen Browett: It was 3 hours 40 minutes long though üò¥
23/10/2018, 8:44 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha

23/10/2018, 8:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Then all questions
23/10/2018, 8:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Wow... then you‚Äôve done really well
23/10/2018, 8:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: Any difficult ones you couldn‚Äôt answer?
23/10/2018, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: My external examiner had a bunch of questions for his own curiosity rather than testing me
23/10/2018, 9:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs good üòä
23/10/2018, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: There were a lot of questions on the solar wind which I wasn't expecting
23/10/2018, 9:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs difficult to know what they‚Äôll focus on though
23/10/2018, 9:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: But I‚Äôm glad it went so well!
23/10/2018, 9:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: When is graduation?
23/10/2018, 9:03 pm - Stephen Browett: It'll be next summer
23/10/2018, 9:03 pm - Stephen Browett: The physics department don't do winter graduations
23/10/2018, 9:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: So long üò¨
23/10/2018, 9:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Boo

23/10/2018, 9:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: When you come to Norway we‚Äôll have to do it!
24/10/2018, 8:12 am - Stephen Browett: Yes! That's so kind, thank you üòÑ
24/10/2018, 8:13 am - Stephen Browett: I'm saving up for the plane ticket over üòù
24/10/2018, 8:16 am - Solveig Andvig: Good! I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll be located at the time, it‚Äôs either kongsberg or Oslo but you‚Äôre welcome to stay either way!
07/11/2018, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is this the new way of talking about gender neutral people?
07/11/2018, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
07/11/2018, 11:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Wtf?!
07/11/2018, 11:12 pm - Stephen Browett: It must be but I've not seen that before!
07/11/2018, 11:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Where did you read that?
08/11/2018, 5:45 am - Solveig Andvig: BBC
08/11/2018, 5:46 am - Solveig Andvig: I think they meant to say ‚Äúthe students and three others‚Äù but the way it was written just made it sound all wrong
08/11/2018, 7:54 am - Stephen Browett: Haha well whatever people want to identify themselves as is fine by me
08/11/2018, 7:54 am - Stephen Browett: Well noticed though lol

12/11/2018, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh no! What happened? üòû
13/11/2018, 5:53 am - Solveig Andvig: Just one of those days where you get fed up with people and life üòÖ
13/11/2018, 7:06 am - Stephen Browett: Haha I know those days
13/11/2018, 7:06 am - Stephen Browett: I call them "Mondays" üòù
13/11/2018, 8:37 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol yes üòÖ

13/11/2018, 5:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I bought myself a new PlayStation game to make you feel better üòù

14/11/2018, 6:35 am - Solveig Andvig: Aww thanks!
14/11/2018, 8:33 am - Stephen Browett: It's more of a bribe than a favour but you're welcome! üòÇ
14/11/2018, 8:34 am - Stephen Browett: Could be a new flat present?
14/11/2018, 8:34 am - Stephen Browett: I assume you're moving to Oslo when you start working there?
14/11/2018, 7:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeees that would be awesome üòÑ and I am going to live in Oslo yes!
14/11/2018, 7:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Sweet! Oslo could be a 'weekend away' break for me as well!
14/11/2018, 7:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe I could hand deliver the game üòù
14/11/2018, 7:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely! You‚Äôre very welcome üòä
14/11/2018, 9:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
15/11/2018, 12:03 am - Stephen Browett: That is distressingly true üòÖ
19/11/2018, 6:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
19/11/2018, 7:57 pm - Stephen Browett: I stare at a treadmill for 2 hours a day üòù
19/11/2018, 7:58 pm - Stephen Browett: <Media omitted>
19/11/2018, 9:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§≠

19/11/2018, 9:44 pm - Stephen Browett: 100% yes ü§£ü§£ü§£
19/11/2018, 9:44 pm - Stephen Browett: That cat is my spirit animal
19/11/2018, 9:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha üòÇüëåüèº

20/11/2018, 8:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Thanks üòÅ I‚Äôm very pleased with the colour! Chose it out in the shop the same day üòÖ
20/11/2018, 10:32 pm - Stephen Browett: You chose it and put it up today?! Good effort! I can barely be arsed to make my own dinner of an evening üòù
20/11/2018, 11:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: No, I chose it on Saturday and spent the weekend finalising üòäüëåüèº
20/11/2018, 11:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Aah! That seems more reasonable üòù
20/11/2018, 11:58 pm - Stephen Browett: I know your motivated so it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that you did all that tonight!
21/11/2018, 6:00 am - Solveig Andvig: That statement shows you don‚Äôt have much experience with home painting üòâ you always need two or more layers for a nice finish and each layer need to be left to dry for some hours (says on the package), but it‚Äôs somewhere between 8-12 hours usually so the best thing is to take one layer each day you‚Äôre painting. üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
21/11/2018, 10:54 am - Stephen Browett: Haha try zero experience with home painting and very little experience with painting in general üòù
21/11/2018, 10:54 am - Stephen Browett: Unless it's ms paint
21/11/2018, 10:55 am - Stephen Browett: Then I have loads of experience üòÇ
21/11/2018, 11:15 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol MS paint is the best!
20/01/2019, 11:45 am - Solveig Andvig: Why do guys enjoy mud wrestling between two women? ü§º‚Äç‚ôÄ
20/01/2019, 1:24 pm - Stephen Browett: This is not a question I was expecting!
20/01/2019, 1:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Errm, the thing is that I don't find it that sexy so I can only speculate
20/01/2019, 1:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Where has this question come from? What have you been chatting about to David and Cari? üòù
20/01/2019, 2:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol it was something David didn‚Äôt want to explain a while ago and he told me to ask you
20/01/2019, 2:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Then he asked me again now
20/01/2019, 4:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha ok üòù
20/01/2019, 4:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Well sometimes women fighting can be sexy if they're tearing at each others clothes
20/01/2019, 4:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Then adding mud into the mix to make them wet and slippery, I can see what that would do for a lot of guys
20/01/2019, 4:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Hang on, I'll Google it üòù
20/01/2019, 4:08 pm - Stephen Browett: OK, Google has informed me that when the clothes get muddy they cling to the girls body so you can see her figure üëç
20/01/2019, 4:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Definitely not creepy at all...
20/01/2019, 5:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: I see...
20/01/2019, 5:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: We still need to plan this reunion in Aberystwyth!
20/01/2019, 8:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes! We all should go in the summer!
20/01/2019, 8:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe June?
20/01/2019, 8:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: Can do ‚ò∫ but then we need to lock down the dates soon so people can actually go!
20/01/2019, 8:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: And book the accommodation etc
20/01/2019, 8:24 pm - Stephen Browett: 15-16th?
20/01/2019, 8:25 pm - Stephen Browett: That's the saturday/sunday
20/01/2019, 8:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Would you prefer to use the Friday and Monday as well swing as you're coming a long way?
20/01/2019, 8:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Seeing*
20/01/2019, 8:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah ‚ò∫
20/01/2019, 8:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: I need to check with my new work how much time off I can take but it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem I think
20/01/2019, 8:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: How are you doing?  Enjoying your new job? üòä
20/01/2019, 9:25 pm - Stephen Browett: It's going really well thanks! üòÑ
20/01/2019, 9:25 pm - Stephen Browett: There's loads to do though and it definitely gets pretty stressy
20/01/2019, 9:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Also, I can't believe I've been there nearly 4 months already!
20/01/2019, 9:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs true!! I forgot about that but time flies
20/01/2019, 9:26 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't think I can call it my "new job" any more
20/01/2019, 9:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
20/01/2019, 9:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre enjoying it ‚ò∫
20/01/2019, 9:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Of course you can üòâ
20/01/2019, 9:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you started your new job yet btw?
20/01/2019, 9:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: No I start 1st feb
20/01/2019, 9:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: The flat is out for sale now so hopefully there will be people here to look at it and wanting to buy it tomorrow
20/01/2019, 9:53 pm - Stephen Browett: That would be amazing! It's so grown up üòù
20/01/2019, 9:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol
20/01/2019, 9:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs part of life
20/01/2019, 9:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Are you at all tempted to take the money from selling your flat and live off the grid on a pacific island?
20/01/2019, 9:54 pm - Stephen Browett: I would be üòÖ
20/01/2019, 9:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely
20/01/2019, 9:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs the dream
20/01/2019, 9:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you even seen the tv program: "Ben Fogle's new lives in the wild"?
20/01/2019, 9:58 pm - Stephen Browett: It's basically a bunch of people who have done exactly that
20/01/2019, 9:58 pm - Stephen Browett: They're all my heroes
20/01/2019, 9:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: No, I haven‚Äôt!
20/01/2019, 9:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôd love to do that
20/01/2019, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: One episode was a Norwegian lady who was living on an island in the Arctic circle and offered for people to come and stay with her for the experience
20/01/2019, 10:01 pm - Stephen Browett: I'd be well up for that!
20/01/2019, 10:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: You should come and see me first!!
20/01/2019, 10:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha good point üòù
20/01/2019, 10:12 pm - Stephen Browett: One thing at a time
01/02/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you still want it back?
01/02/2019, 9:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'd totally forgotten about that! I'll have to come and collect it! üòÑ
01/02/2019, 9:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes üòÅ
01/02/2019, 9:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: I promised I‚Äôd not throw it away!
01/02/2019, 9:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbf, you're true to your word!
01/02/2019, 9:55 pm - Stephen Browett: In thinking of coming early summer, does that work for you?
01/02/2019, 9:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Probably but what is early summer for you? That means June here üòÅ
01/02/2019, 10:18 pm - Stephen Browett: Probably may üòù
01/02/2019, 10:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Just because I might be going to Brazil in June üòÖ
01/02/2019, 10:19 pm - Stephen Browett: #jetset
01/02/2019, 10:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: What! And I got no invite üòë
02/02/2019, 4:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'm sure John and suhayl would love to have to come as well üòÑ
13/02/2019, 4:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok, I need some help
13/02/2019, 4:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Waddup buddy?
13/02/2019, 5:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: How to tell someone you‚Äôre not interested in a nice way?
13/02/2019, 10:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Ooh tough one!
13/02/2019, 10:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Sorry I didn't reply earlier, I could only think of joke responses üòÖ
13/02/2019, 10:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Is it someone you work with or a friend?
14/02/2019, 5:29 am - Solveig Andvig: Neither üòÖ I tried tinder but it‚Äôs not for me and the guy is nice but not for me I think
14/02/2019, 7:11 am - Stephen Browett: Well, you could just ghost him by not messaging him any more
14/02/2019, 7:12 am - Stephen Browett: I thought a lot of people in time do that
14/02/2019, 7:12 am - Stephen Browett: Otherwise, if he tries asking you on a date then just say you're not into it
14/02/2019, 7:13 am - Stephen Browett: Btw you're definitely showing me your tinder profile when I come and visit you üòù
14/02/2019, 7:15 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol I‚Äôm deleting it

14/02/2019, 9:26 am - Stephen Browett: I just want to judge you üòÇ
14/02/2019, 9:26 am - Solveig Andvig: No I sent him a message now actually
14/02/2019, 9:26 am - Solveig Andvig: Be careful, I‚Äôll strike back harder than you do to me
14/02/2019, 9:27 am - Solveig Andvig: You don‚Äôt know what tricks and info I‚Äôve got up my sleeve
14/02/2019, 9:27 am - Solveig Andvig: üòâ
14/02/2019, 9:27 am - Stephen Browett: I believe that and it's terrifying üòÖ

14/02/2019, 10:35 am - Stephen Browett: That's you looking for who's throne you need to usurp üòù
14/02/2019, 11:11 am - Solveig Andvig: Ok then üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ

14/02/2019, 6:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Can‚Äôt wait
14/02/2019, 6:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Just a quick question for the profile, would you say that you have an extreme foot fetish or a mild one? üòÅ
14/02/2019, 6:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: üôà
14/02/2019, 6:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm not supposed to help you with this!

14/02/2019, 7:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: That sounds like a perfect plan! Can I join?

23/02/2019, 1:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Have you set a date for when you‚Äôre coming to visit? üòÅ
01/03/2019, 6:20 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol, Norwegians are the worst at parallel parking üòÇüòÇ
01/03/2019, 6:20 am - Solveig Andvig: Even here in Oslo they struggle and it seems to be the only form of parking they should be able to do since all the parking spaces are along the roads
01/03/2019, 6:21 am - Solveig Andvig: I just watched a guy try to park while waiting for the bus. It was kind of him to humour me at this time in the morning.
01/03/2019, 10:43 am - Stephen Browett: üòÇüòÇüòÇüëå
01/03/2019, 10:44 am - Stephen Browett: Record him next time, really pile on the pressure  üòù
01/03/2019, 11:36 am - Solveig Andvig: lol I could have done
06/03/2019, 4:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: What are you up to? How‚Äôs work going? You‚Äôve been there for a while now and I haven‚Äôt heard anything!
07/03/2019, 8:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Everything is going pretty sweet atm! üòÑ
07/03/2019, 8:20 pm - Stephen Browett: I had a cold at the start of this week but it's clearing up now and I've been spending my time making slightly shitty ios apps üòÖ
07/03/2019, 8:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I can send you the code for a slightly bad xylophone app for ios if you like? üòÇ
07/03/2019, 8:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol, is that what you‚Äôre working on?
07/03/2019, 9:31 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha kind of üòù
07/03/2019, 9:31 pm - Stephen Browett: It's part of some training for iOS that I'm doing atm
07/03/2019, 9:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Has no business value but making the app has taught me how to interact with the APIs on an iPhone which I will need to know
08/03/2019, 5:08 am - Solveig Andvig: APIs?
08/03/2019, 5:09 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm interested in knowing what you actually do / will be doing ‚ò∫
08/03/2019, 5:40 pm - Stephen Browett: It stands for application programming interface
08/03/2019, 5:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Basically some code I write can interact with some code other people have written through it
08/03/2019, 5:53 pm - Stephen Browett: And you're too kind üòä but there's not much to it really
08/03/2019, 6:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Right so it‚Äôs a flexible interface, like a connection?
08/03/2019, 6:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Pretty much! Although a 'connection' isn't really made, it's more like my code will say "can you work out this bit of information from the data you have?" and the other code will work it out and return the information to me then I carry on with what I'm doing
03/05/2019, 7:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hey stranger
03/05/2019, 7:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôre being awfully quiet
03/05/2019, 10:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Hey you! üòÑ
I know I have üòû but I was thinking about you the today, how weird that you chose today to message me!
03/05/2019, 10:35 pm - Stephen Browett: How are you?
04/05/2019, 12:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha thanks for the conpensating instagram spam of likes üòâ I‚Äôm alright! Had a really nice lie in this morning and taking things slow today. How are you?
05/05/2019, 9:53 am - Stephen Browett: Are you back from your holidays now? I saw a buck of photos on Facebook from exotic places! üòÑ
05/05/2019, 11:49 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah ‚ò∫ was amazing!
05/05/2019, 12:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Where did you go?
05/05/2019, 12:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Bangkok -> Siem Reap -> Phom Phen -> Koh Rong -> Ho Chi Mihn
05/05/2019, 2:09 pm - Stephen Browett: I've heard of two of those places üòÖ
05/05/2019, 2:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs mostly in Cambodia üòÖ
05/05/2019, 2:11 pm - Stephen Browett: The two I know are the two that aren't in Cambodia
05/05/2019, 2:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
05/05/2019, 2:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah I see but then you know the rest of them are
05/05/2019, 2:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Google maps is a wonderful tool üòÇ
06/05/2019, 7:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: So how‚Äôs your life Steve?
06/05/2019, 7:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Just plodding along atm. Kind of biding my time before looking for a promotion at work and buying my own house üòÖ
06/05/2019, 7:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I kind of want to be doing more though
06/05/2019, 7:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I just haven't quite decided what I want to be doing more of üòù
06/05/2019, 7:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Does that make any sense? üòÇ
06/05/2019, 8:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, I‚Äôm like that
06/05/2019, 8:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: What is the promotion?
06/05/2019, 8:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: And are you buying a house with holly?? üòÅ
07/05/2019, 9:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Hopefully test team manager but it might not become available for a little while yet
07/05/2019, 9:51 pm - Stephen Browett: In the meantime I'm keeping an eye open to see if a data scientist position becomes available üòÑ
07/05/2019, 9:52 pm - Stephen Browett: And I might buy a house with Holly but I've got to see how it goes
07/05/2019, 9:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Very exciting! I‚Äôd like a data scientist role myself üòé 

How what goes?
08/05/2019, 6:36 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm not sure that we have jobs close enough to each other to be able to live together and I'm not sure what to do about that
08/05/2019, 7:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah... yes I understand that. Where does she work now? Is all well with you two?
08/05/2019, 10:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, it's fine. It's just me being stupid as always
08/05/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: I suspect I'm just freaking out that if Holly and I move in together then that's really serious and I'm not sure I'm ready for it
08/05/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: On the other hand I'm 26 and should probably grow up
08/05/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Fun times...
08/05/2019, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ah! I get that, it does make it more serious since you‚Äôve been together for so long already
08/05/2019, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hah, don‚Äôt think that, I‚Äôm 28 and I haven‚Äôt for my life together üòÇ
08/05/2019, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: *got my life
08/05/2019, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you know why you‚Äôre scared of it becoming more serious?
08/05/2019, 10:25 pm - Stephen Browett: The usual stuff I guess, not sure if we're right for each other and wondering what my life will be like if I stayed with Holly
08/05/2019, 10:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôve already figured out a lot I think
08/05/2019, 10:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Don‚Äôt stress too much with a house together and find out what you really want ‚ò∫
08/05/2019, 10:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: And get your own place in the meanwhile üëåüèº
08/05/2019, 10:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Bad advise?
08/05/2019, 10:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Advice üòù
08/05/2019, 10:27 pm - Stephen Browett: And if I had the money I'd have done that already üòÖ
08/05/2019, 10:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha
08/05/2019, 10:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Thanks! üòÇ
08/05/2019, 10:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I always get it wrong
08/05/2019, 10:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think you should move to Oslo to hang out with me instead
08/05/2019, 10:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
08/05/2019, 10:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha sounds like a good idea to me!
08/05/2019, 10:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Or we could elope? üòù
08/05/2019, 10:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Then you have nothing more to worry about
08/05/2019, 10:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol! Let‚Äôs do that
08/05/2019, 10:30 pm - Stephen Browett: üëç Problem solved!
08/05/2019, 10:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Must be somewhere exotic though
08/05/2019, 10:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: I look good with a tan
08/05/2019, 10:32 pm - Stephen Browett: And I'll still be wearing jeans and a t-shirt üö∂üèª
08/05/2019, 10:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe a Caribbean island?
08/05/2019, 10:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Or a Pacific island
08/05/2019, 10:33 pm - Stephen Browett: As long as it's an island...
08/05/2019, 10:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Island is good enough for me!
08/05/2019, 10:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: And why jeans?!
08/05/2019, 10:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll teach you how to dress properly if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for
08/05/2019, 10:33 pm - Stephen Browett: It's my usual attire üòù
08/05/2019, 10:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Not at all haha
08/05/2019, 10:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÅ
08/05/2019, 10:34 pm - Stephen Browett: It was just more of a warning than a cry for help üòÇ
08/05/2019, 10:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah don‚Äôt be offended
08/05/2019, 10:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have the same skills as the gay guys in queer eye when it comes to style üòé
08/05/2019, 10:45 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha! ü§£
08/05/2019, 10:45 pm - Stephen Browett: What skills are those
08/05/2019, 10:45 pm - Stephen Browett: ?
08/05/2019, 10:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Fashion, I assume? üòÜ
08/05/2019, 10:46 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm unteachable in that regard üòù
09/05/2019, 11:11 am - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôre underestimating and misjudging my manipulation skills üòå
09/05/2019, 2:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Sorry, I had only read as far as "same skills as the gay guys" before I thought of a sarky reply üòù
09/05/2019, 2:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Are those manipulation skills the same ones that are tempting me to move to Norway? üòù
09/05/2019, 3:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: Probably ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
09/05/2019, 3:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: Does that mean you‚Äôre not coming??
09/05/2019, 10:07 pm - Stephen Browett: To live? Possibly not...
09/05/2019, 10:07 pm - Stephen Browett: To visit? Definitely! üòÑ
09/05/2019, 10:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Let‚Äôs start with a visit then - you‚Äôre long overdue so just book your tickets üòâ
09/05/2019, 10:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Sounds like a plan, I'm booking holidays this month üëç
09/05/2019, 10:12 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm thinking it'll either have to be June or September üòù
09/05/2019, 10:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Does either of those not work for you?
09/05/2019, 10:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Let me check my calendar tomorrow and get back to you ‚ò∫
09/05/2019, 11:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Perfect! üëå
10/05/2019, 6:24 am - Solveig Andvig: So in June it‚Äôs starting to fill up and I‚Äôll have a deadline for a proposal and negotiations going on as well as miscellaneous private things earlier in the month, however, if you come towards the end of first week in July there‚Äôs the jazz festival on in kongsberg which is good fun (Friday-Sunday) but would cost a little because of tickets and of course we‚Äôll have to visit Oslo too üëåüèº otherwise I think September is better, so far I only know I‚Äôll be away 5-8th September ‚ò∫
10/05/2019, 5:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Ooh! I do like jazz! I'll take a look tonight and see if I fancy it üòÉ
10/05/2019, 6:11 pm - Solveig Andvig: I forgot to mention that there‚Äôs very little jazz at the jazz festival haha
10/05/2019, 6:11 pm - Solveig Andvig: The main line up are artists such as Alan Walker
10/05/2019, 7:44 pm - Stephen Browett: He doesn't do jazz üòÇ
10/05/2019, 7:44 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe September then üòù
11/05/2019, 9:31 am - Solveig Andvig: Haha he doesn‚Äôt üòÇ
13/05/2019, 11:04 pm - Stephen Browett: How about if I came to yours from the 6th to the 9th of September? üòÑ
13/05/2019, 11:04 pm - Stephen Browett: You live in Oslo now, right?
14/05/2019, 5:44 am - Solveig Andvig: Hehe, you chose the only time I‚Äôm away in September üòâ I‚Äôm in Oslo yes, so easiest is to get to Gardermoen - not too late - and not torp
14/05/2019, 12:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Nailed it! üòÇ
14/05/2019, 12:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe the weekend after then?
14/05/2019, 1:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sure, weekend after I‚Äôm free üòÅ
15/05/2019, 10:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Booked tickets yet??
15/05/2019, 10:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: I haven‚Äôt taken out any holiday and need something to spend it on so if you want to plan something ‚Äúmore‚Äù let me know!
16/05/2019, 8:01 pm - Stephen Browett: I haven't booked the tickets yet but I have put in the leave request at work! üòÑ
16/05/2019, 8:01 pm - Stephen Browett: What do you mean by "more"? As in a longer holiday or visiting somewhere else in Norway?
16/05/2019, 8:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Or going on holiday to Iceland later in the year? üòù
17/05/2019, 5:18 am - Solveig Andvig: All of the suggestions ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
17/05/2019, 6:55 pm - Stephen Browett: I've been looking for someone to go to Iceland with me for ages!
17/05/2019, 6:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Or we could climb a mountain?
17/05/2019, 6:55 pm - Stephen Browett: I fancy breaking through my 6000m barrier with the next mountain
17/05/2019, 6:56 pm - Stephen Browett: üòÅ
17/05/2019, 6:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Again both would be great, but I‚Äôm not sure if starting by breaking the 6000m is the best for someone who‚Äôs not used to climbing mountains üòÖüò¨üòü
17/05/2019, 6:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Unless you‚Äôll carry me because you‚Äôve been upgraded to become a Sherpa?
20/05/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha I'm not in the same league as those guys, they're superhuman!
20/05/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm sure we could think of something üòÑ
20/05/2019, 10:23 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll book the flights tomorrow and see how much money I've got left for other excursions üòÑ
21/05/2019, 10:45 am - Solveig Andvig: Yay!
21/05/2019, 10:45 am - Solveig Andvig: It will be so nice to see you again anyway
21/05/2019, 10:45 am - Solveig Andvig: üòä
21/05/2019, 8:47 pm - Stephen Browett: <Media omitted>
21/05/2019, 9:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ahhh!!! This got me so excited!
21/05/2019, 9:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: September will be fun üòÅüëåüèº
23/05/2019, 5:51 am - Solveig Andvig: Let me know if there‚Äôs something in particular you want to see in Oslo!
23/05/2019, 11:37 am - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôve seen the last GoT episode?
24/05/2019, 6:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes! So hyped for September now! üòÑ
24/05/2019, 6:36 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll start looking up cool things to do in Oslo
24/05/2019, 6:36 pm - Stephen Browett: What do you like to do there?
24/05/2019, 6:36 pm - Stephen Browett: You need to take me out to the cool (cheap) pubs and bars üòù
24/05/2019, 6:37 pm - Stephen Browett: And yes, I've seen the last episode! What did you think?
24/05/2019, 6:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha I know a few cool places but they‚Äôre not cheap
24/05/2019, 6:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: I hated it
24/05/2019, 6:37 pm - Stephen Browett: The whole thing felt rushed to me
24/05/2019, 6:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Such a shame for what was a cool series
24/05/2019, 6:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: I agree
24/05/2019, 6:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
24/05/2019, 6:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
24/05/2019, 6:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Why can dani only count to 20?
24/05/2019, 6:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Jon's ending was terrible
24/05/2019, 6:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Greyworm forces him to rejoin the night's watch then Greyworm leaves and Jon is made to stay in the night's watch?
24/05/2019, 6:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: She said that in the episode üòÇ when Jon killed her
24/05/2019, 6:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yeah he‚Äôs a dick with no dick
24/05/2019, 6:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Right?!
24/05/2019, 6:57 pm - Stephen Browett: And Jon and greyworm were good friends (or so I thought)
24/05/2019, 6:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah yes
24/05/2019, 6:58 pm - Stephen Browett: That had a whole "if greyworm was still a slave, this wouldn't have happened" vibe
24/05/2019, 6:58 pm - Stephen Browett: Basically saying slavery is good...
24/05/2019, 6:58 pm - Stephen Browett: I have opinions üòÖ
24/05/2019, 7:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha! I can tell
24/05/2019, 7:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: And wow what a conclusion

26/05/2019, 1:08 am - Solveig Andvig: What did I search to deserve this?!?
26/05/2019, 1:15 am - Solveig Andvig: Apparently I‚Äôm supposed to prepare for some weird bdsm shit which will end in pregnancy
26/05/2019, 1:21 pm - Stephen Browett: And the baby will be born backwards because its drunk on all the beer you were drinking out of your beer belly pouch üòÇ
26/05/2019, 1:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Those are the best! ü§£ü§£

30/05/2019, 12:14 am - Stephen Browett: I have questions...
30/05/2019, 12:15 am - Stephen Browett: Such as: what is that thing?! üòÇ
30/05/2019, 12:15 am - Stephen Browett: When I come to visit in going to Google some really of things and see what shopping suggestions you get üòÅ
30/05/2019, 12:16 am - Stephen Browett: Really odd things*
30/05/2019, 1:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have no idea what that thing is
30/05/2019, 1:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs disturbing üòÇ
30/05/2019, 9:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: what time do you arrive and leave oslo when you visit? I'm just wondering if I should take the day off or if I can "work from home" :P
30/05/2019, 9:53 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm landing in Oslo at 6pm on Friday (just in time for dinner üòú) and leaving on the Monday at 1pm
30/05/2019, 9:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok, thanks üòäüëåüèº
30/05/2019, 9:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Sorry, that probably means it's not worth taking the day off...
30/05/2019, 9:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs not a problem!
05/06/2019, 7:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Seen peaky blinders? I don‚Äôt think they sound like brummies....
05/06/2019, 8:02 pm - Stephen Browett: I love peaky blinders!
05/06/2019, 8:03 pm - Stephen Browett: The first season sounds a bit odd but the accents get better in later seasons üòù
05/06/2019, 8:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you just started watching it?
05/06/2019, 8:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah üòÅ
05/06/2019, 8:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: How come it gets better?
05/06/2019, 8:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Did they teach them how to talk properly or did the brummy accent develop over time?
05/06/2019, 8:05 pm - Stephen Browett: I suspect it was being taught because, let's face it, they need the tuition üòÇ
05/06/2019, 8:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahahah üòÇ
05/06/2019, 8:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Maybe you should get a side job and teach them how it‚Äôs done?
05/06/2019, 8:08 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha if the pay is good then I'll teach them some brummy
05/06/2019, 8:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Will you teach me for free??
05/06/2019, 8:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha sure!
05/06/2019, 8:09 pm - Stephen Browett: There will be an assessment at the end of the weekend I come over üòù
05/06/2019, 8:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect
05/06/2019, 8:10 pm - Stephen Browett: If I teach you properly then southerners will struggle to understand you üòÖ
05/06/2019, 8:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha yes
05/06/2019, 8:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: And David will hate me
05/06/2019, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is the series based on any true historical events?
05/06/2019, 8:31 pm - Stephen Browett: ü§£
05/06/2019, 8:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Not really, there were violent gangs back then and one called the "brumingham boys" (so cool...) was run by a family who ran a bookies like the peaky blinders
05/06/2019, 8:34 pm - Stephen Browett: But it's mostly made up
05/06/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok üòÅ
05/06/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Apparently my grandads dad was part of one of these groups in Oslo
05/06/2019, 8:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: The ‚ÄúAndvig gang‚Äù or something of the sort
05/06/2019, 8:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: He never met him because he was a criminal and we only found out like 10 years ago when both of them were dead
05/06/2019, 8:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also, a couple of years ago a new article came out where his gang was suspected of murdering someone but there were never any evidence so they couldn‚Äôt be prisoned
05/06/2019, 8:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: They were inspired by the American mafia
05/06/2019, 8:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Really?!
05/06/2019, 8:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Remind me to never piss you off üòÖ
05/06/2019, 8:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Thought you already knew that?
05/06/2019, 8:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha of course, sorry, please forgive me üòù
05/06/2019, 8:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you ever wonder what it would have been like to meet him though?
05/06/2019, 8:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Nah
05/06/2019, 8:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don‚Äôt really care for people who don‚Äôt want to be part of my life
05/06/2019, 8:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Their loss
05/06/2019, 8:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
05/06/2019, 8:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: If I was someone else I‚Äôd marry me
05/06/2019, 9:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Good attitude!
05/06/2019, 9:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Never change üòÑ
05/06/2019, 9:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Only for the better üòâ haha
05/06/2019, 9:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm definitely not the same person as I was 10 years ago
06/06/2019, 8:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: You should watch Chernobyl on hbo
06/06/2019, 8:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs really good!
06/06/2019, 11:18 pm - Stephen Browett: I've seen the first 4 episodes! I love it!
06/06/2019, 11:18 pm - Stephen Browett: How much have you seen?
06/06/2019, 11:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Before I start chatting about my favourite bits üòù
07/06/2019, 5:47 am - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha only the first three üòâ
07/06/2019, 7:53 am - Stephen Browett: Is that where the guys have just gone into the building to turn on the water pumps?
07/06/2019, 7:56 am - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs where they shoot the puppies üò≠üò≠
07/06/2019, 7:58 am - Stephen Browett: Ah no! That bit sucks üò´
07/06/2019, 7:58 am - Stephen Browett: That kid becomes a bit od a psycho pretty quickly
07/06/2019, 8:00 am - Solveig Andvig: Shhhh
07/06/2019, 8:22 am - Stephen Browett: Well I've clearly forgotten where the episodes start and end üòÖ
07/06/2019, 8:22 am - Stephen Browett: What you've definitely seen though are the egg baskets üòÇ
07/06/2019, 8:22 am - Stephen Browett: Those things are hilarious ü§£
07/06/2019, 8:42 am - Solveig Andvig: I can‚Äôt remember this???
07/06/2019, 11:47 am - Stephen Browett: The lead thing that they wear when they're out shooting puppies
07/06/2019, 11:48 am - Stephen Browett: To protect their 'egg baskets' üòú
07/06/2019, 11:52 am - Solveig Andvig: Oh yeah!!
07/06/2019, 11:52 am - Solveig Andvig: I noticed them haha
07/06/2019, 12:06 pm - Stephen Browett: I wanted to know if they actually used egg baskets and it doesn't look like they did but I found this fun quote
07/06/2019, 12:06 pm - Stephen Browett: The pilots had a rhyme about it ‚Äî ‚Äú‚ÄúYesli hochesh byt‚Äô otsom/zakrivay yaitso svintsom‚Äù ‚Äî which, translated, meant, ‚ÄúIf you want to be a dad/cover your balls with lead.‚Äù
07/06/2019, 12:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Seems reasonable üòù
07/06/2019, 12:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha absolutely!
07/06/2019, 12:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good thinking
09/06/2019, 11:22 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll have pre drinks at our place on the Saturday before we go out üòÅ Norway‚Äôs too expensive to buy all the drinks out on town
09/06/2019, 11:23 am - Solveig Andvig: Did you see any tourist attractions when you visited Oslo previously?
09/06/2019, 11:01 pm - Stephen Browett: That sounds amazing!
09/06/2019, 11:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Last time I was in Oslo I was only there for a day so I pretty much just took in the sights. I didn't really 'do' anything üòÖ
10/06/2019, 2:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is there anything you‚Äôd like to do or should I choose something I think could be fun? Like, do you want to visit museums, go out and see the city, activities?
10/06/2019, 10:38 pm - Stephen Browett: A couple museums are always good, the Viking ship museum looks cool (although I've not looked at reviews) but I don't know which ones are good. I've read about slottsplassen which looks like it'll be a good place to take some pictures
10/06/2019, 10:39 pm - Stephen Browett: But if you know of some cool places to go, I'd rather go there üòÉ
10/06/2019, 10:39 pm - Stephen Browett: You've got to take me to a good foodie restaurant, is my only requirement üòù
10/06/2019, 10:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll take you to good restaurants, don‚Äôt worry üòâ
10/06/2019, 10:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: And we can go to Bygd√∏y for the biking museum and possibly fram and kon tiki museum too?
10/06/2019, 10:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: The fram museum is about the polar expedition where the brits failed massively ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
10/06/2019, 10:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I‚Äôll of course take you to the palace and the fortress, and also the opera house and some other nice scenic places
10/06/2019, 10:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs possible to rent a floating sauna and go swimming in the fjord too, but we‚Äôd have to be more point - otherwise quite expensive üòÖ
10/06/2019, 10:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hmm...
10/06/2019, 10:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: Still have plenty of time to decide on what to do!
10/06/2019, 10:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha taking horses and snowmobiles to the south Pole... What were they thinking?! üòÇ
10/06/2019, 10:46 pm - Stephen Browett: A floating sauna sounds amazing!
10/06/2019, 10:46 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll have to hit the gym if we're going to do that haha
10/06/2019, 10:47 pm - Stephen Browett: How expensive is it BTW? Just a guess is fine
10/06/2019, 10:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: Pff we are all humans with bodies of various sizes and shapes, don‚Äôt worry about it üòÅ
10/06/2019, 10:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think we calculated that 300kr or something per person if there were 12 of us
10/06/2019, 10:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
10/06/2019, 10:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: I can‚Äôt remember but I can‚Äôt verify that
10/06/2019, 10:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: I can verify
10/06/2019, 10:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Meh... autocorrect is not my friend today
10/06/2019, 10:48 pm - Stephen Browett: No rush! But that does sound good, and the swimming in a fjord
10/06/2019, 10:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok, I‚Äôll check it out üòÅ haven‚Äôt tried it myself but really want to!
10/06/2019, 10:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I've not been swimming in literally years so it'll probably be quite funny for you üòù
10/06/2019, 10:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good üòâ I‚Äôm counting on many laughs over the weekend we‚Äôre together
10/06/2019, 10:53 pm - Stephen Browett: There's no doubt about that! üòÑ
11/06/2019, 7:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2019/05/20/this-bizarre-oslo-sculpture-park-reveals-humanitys-innermost-emotions/
11/06/2019, 11:04 pm - Stephen Browett: I was looking this place up on trip advisor üòÖ
11/06/2019, 11:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Is it any good?
11/06/2019, 11:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah üòÅüëåüèº
12/06/2019, 4:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Amazing! Then we should go! üòÑ
12/06/2019, 4:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you know any cool places with some live music?
12/06/2019, 4:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Might be good for an evening drink?
12/06/2019, 4:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve been trying to find a place myself, but it‚Äôs not a big thing here like in the UK... but there should be somewhere with music
12/06/2019, 4:20 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll keep searching üòÅ
12/06/2019, 6:44 pm - Stephen Browett: I know that'll be a hardship for you üòù
12/06/2019, 6:44 pm - Stephen Browett: At this rate, a weekend won't be anywhere near enough time to do everything!
12/06/2019, 6:45 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe I'll have to stay for longer üòù
12/06/2019, 6:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think you should
12/06/2019, 6:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Or you‚Äôll have to come back very soon
12/06/2019, 7:03 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm glad you said that, otherwise I'm just inviting myself over to your house üòù
12/06/2019, 7:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôre welcome anytime üòä

16/06/2019, 7:29 pm - Stephen Browett: A lot of it is male stuff as well, what are you using this stuff for? üòù
17/06/2019, 6:21 am - Solveig Andvig: ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
17/06/2019, 6:21 am - Solveig Andvig: Visitors?
17/06/2019, 8:07 am - Stephen Browett: Well that's terrifying üòÇ
17/06/2019, 8:12 am - Solveig Andvig: üòâ
17/06/2019, 8:27 pm - Stephen Browett: I reckon I could rock the man - bra with matching jock strap (the second picture)
17/06/2019, 8:28 pm - Stephen Browett: That or the princess leia golden bikini, if look good in that üòÅ
17/06/2019, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll get the Princess Leia costume
17/06/2019, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: For you üòâ
17/06/2019, 8:52 pm - Stephen Browett: You're too kind, I promise I'll wear it üòÜ

29/06/2019, 2:38 pm - Stephen Browett: So is my present being delivered or will it be waiting for me for when I grt to yours? üòù
29/06/2019, 2:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: When you come and visit üòÅ
29/06/2019, 11:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha üòÑ (I was just kidding btw, you don't have to get me a present)
29/06/2019, 11:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: But the Princess Leia costume ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
29/06/2019, 11:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes! I mean, that'd be very kind of you if you got it for me... üòè
29/06/2019, 11:27 pm - Stephen Browett: *smooth*
29/06/2019, 11:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòéüòé
29/06/2019, 11:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think you‚Äôll look fabulous in it
29/06/2019, 11:28 pm - Stephen Browett: Please, I make anything  look fabulous üòù
29/06/2019, 11:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: True, my bad üò¨

29/06/2019, 11:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Going out tonight?
29/06/2019, 11:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Spent today with my family so it was just bowling and dinner, going out with my mates tomorrow üòù
29/06/2019, 11:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sunday?!?
29/06/2019, 11:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is holly not visiting?
29/06/2019, 11:38 pm - Stephen Browett: That's how I roll!
29/06/2019, 11:38 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, she's round atm but she works near brum so she'll stay over tomorrow night as well
29/06/2019, 11:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha, why not!!
29/06/2019, 11:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounds nice üòä
29/06/2019, 11:44 pm - Stephen Browett: Should be really good! BTW if you ever come over to visit then I'll take you to the digbeth dining club, it's a collection of award winning street food vendors with music and cocktails. So good!
30/06/2019, 9:09 am - Solveig Andvig: I am visiting the UK this summer if you have some spare time around 15th - 20th July?
30/06/2019, 9:09 am - Solveig Andvig: I have book a one-way ticket, but need to finalise my plans for where to go haha
30/06/2019, 12:54 pm - Stephen Browett: You've only booked a one-way ticket? You're such a free spirit!
30/06/2019, 12:55 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm sure I could be free on the Thursday or Friday
30/06/2019, 12:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Possibly on the saturday
30/06/2019, 3:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes why not ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
04/08/2019, 12:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: What should we consider doing in Iceland then? üòÅ
04/08/2019, 1:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeees! I knew you'd get on board!
04/08/2019, 1:14 pm - Stephen Browett: We could hire a campervan and do the ring road around Iceland?
04/08/2019, 1:15 pm - Stephen Browett: Alternatively, we could just hire a car and stay in raykyavik
04/08/2019, 1:15 pm - Stephen Browett: Seeing the sights around there?
04/08/2019, 1:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Depends on when we‚Äôre going üôà
04/08/2019, 1:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: In the winter the campervan will be freezing cold
04/08/2019, 7:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, maybe that's not a "this year" plan üòÖ
05/08/2019, 7:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Exactly üòâ however, hot natural springs and the aurora - yes!
05/08/2019, 7:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve heard the winter is not the best time for a road trip though... if caught in a storm you‚Äôre stuck
06/08/2019, 11:01 am - Stephen Browett: And maybe you're used to driving on icy roads but us brits have a tradition of crashing as soon as snow appears üòÇ
06/08/2019, 11:12 am - Solveig Andvig: I have the sensibility to respect the weather üôà if there‚Äôs a storm I won‚Äôt be driving around haha
06/08/2019, 4:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Ah, it's that sensibility that I lack
06/08/2019, 4:27 pm - Stephen Browett: If you don't try, you don't know I reckon üòú
13/08/2019, 8:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: do you have the time for when you fly in and out so I can start make some plans? :)
13/08/2019, 8:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Definitely!
13/08/2019, 8:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Floating sauna? üòÑ
13/08/2019, 8:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: haha, yes, I will try to get a group together, but I don't trust people fully... but there's an alternative to have a drop in where you are in a "public sauna" and can run out and jump in the water
13/08/2019, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Either sounds good to me, I don't mind paying a bit more if there's only a small group btw
13/08/2019, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: What other plans were you thinking of?
13/08/2019, 9:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: I haven‚Äôt decided, loads of opportunities, depends on what you‚Äôd like to do?
13/08/2019, 9:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: We can do museums or we can walk around the city and explore some of the local places and areas that are interesting
13/08/2019, 9:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think walking around is going to be interesting, but it‚Äôs up to you!
13/08/2019, 9:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: And of course a night out on the Saturday. I was thinking maybe a house party first, then go out
13/08/2019, 9:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: And we can have brunch at the local cafe on Sunday
13/08/2019, 10:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Exploring the city sounds like fun!
13/08/2019, 10:14 pm - Stephen Browett: You can give me a tour of all the cool places üòÑ
13/08/2019, 10:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Will try to! There‚Äôs lots I haven‚Äôt explored myself, but there are some cool places we should go to and Oslo is easy to cover in a day or two by foot - as long as we‚Äôre not stopping by every shop
13/08/2019, 10:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: If there‚Äôs nice weather we could also go to some of the islands and have a walk around
13/08/2019, 10:17 pm - Stephen Browett: That sounds cool too! Boat trip!
13/08/2019, 10:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeees
13/08/2019, 10:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok, I have a few things in mind then, I‚Äôll try to make some plans üòÅ but you didn‚Äôt give me the time you arrive and depart?
13/08/2019, 10:19 pm - Stephen Browett: I arrive at 6pm Friday and leave 1pm Monday
13/08/2019, 10:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok, thanks üòä it‚Äôs mainly Saturday and Sunday we can have activities then
13/08/2019, 10:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, travel to and from the airport on this side is a pain üòû
13/08/2019, 10:36 pm - Stephen Browett: But maybe when I'm in my own place you could come and visit! üòÑ
13/08/2019, 10:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely! Are you planning on buying something soon?
13/08/2019, 11:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Hopefully next year ü§û
13/08/2019, 11:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Nice üòÅ what area?
13/08/2019, 11:06 pm - Stephen Browett: I haven't decided yet, it depends on what I'm doing at the time but maybe in Central Birmingham
13/08/2019, 11:06 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll take you to digbeth which is the best area in brum (if you've not been already)
13/08/2019, 11:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounds good! I have no idea where I was when I visited Birmingham so I‚Äôm sure you can take me anywhere and it will all seem new to me üòÇüëåüèº
13/08/2019, 11:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: So really NO pressure!
13/08/2019, 11:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Are you still at your parents house now?
13/08/2019, 11:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Yep! 27 and back a mom and dad's house... I'm thrilled about it üòù
13/08/2019, 11:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha, I was at my mums house for a year after uni before getting my own place
13/08/2019, 11:12 pm - Stephen Browett: And it's actually mega convenient while saving up the house deposit, isn't it? üòù
13/08/2019, 11:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Exactly!
13/08/2019, 11:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Besides, you don‚Äôt have to cook your own meal every day (I assume?)
13/08/2019, 11:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I do üòÇ
13/08/2019, 11:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't have to do laundry though!
13/08/2019, 11:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah at least that‚Äôs something üòâ
14/08/2019, 9:22 am - Stephen Browett: Don't be mean, I'm a strong independent man who doesn't need looking after by his parents üòù
14/08/2019, 9:50 am - Solveig Andvig: We all enjoy being spoilt from time to time
14/08/2019, 10:38 am - Solveig Andvig: Apparently there are lots of free events on when you‚Äôre visiting so if I find anything interesting we‚Äôll stop by to see what‚Äôs on üòä
14/08/2019, 1:36 pm - Stephen Browett: That sounds fun üòÑ are the events listed online anywhere? I'd love to take a look
14/08/2019, 1:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not yet, which I can‚Äôt plan anything üòÖ they just say there‚Äôs going to be events
14/08/2019, 5:24 pm - Stephen Browett: That's good üòÇ
14/08/2019, 5:24 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm always up for trying good street food though if you know anywhere?
14/08/2019, 5:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes, I know the perfect place!
14/08/2019, 5:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: There‚Äôs a big food court for exactly that
14/08/2019, 5:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: If the weathers nice we can buy some there and go and sit but the river or in the park
14/08/2019, 9:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes! That sounds awesome üòÑ
14/08/2019, 9:52 pm - Stephen Browett: I think we should just commit to doing that in shorts and t-shirts whatever the weather üòù
14/08/2019, 9:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha! Judging by the weather we‚Äôve had so far in August it‚Äôs going to be cold!
14/08/2019, 9:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôre already pushing us into the fjord in the middle of autumn!
14/08/2019, 11:07 pm - Stephen Browett: That's the whole point of saunas, right? To go from very hot to very cold? üòù
14/08/2019, 11:08 pm - Stephen Browett: But yes, I will be pushing you into the fjord. Just as a heads up üòÅ
15/08/2019, 5:31 am - Solveig Andvig: ü§≠
17/08/2019, 8:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve sent out the invitations so hopefully people will join in üòÅ
18/08/2019, 12:45 am - Stephen Browett: Woo! üòÑ
18/08/2019, 12:46 am - Stephen Browett: Now I need to buy a swimming costume and go to the gym üòù
18/08/2019, 12:46 am - Stephen Browett: This will be awesome though, thanks for organising üòÑ
18/08/2019, 8:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha at least get a swimming costume üòâ
18/08/2019, 9:38 pm - Stephen Browett: That's this week's task üòù
18/08/2019, 9:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: No speedos!
30/08/2019, 12:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: So what I suspected is happening; people say they really want to try the floating sauna and are super keen but when it comes to actually planning things they back out
30/08/2019, 12:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm not sure if we have enough people with us to justify the cost?
30/08/2019, 12:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: We can still go swimming in the fjord if you want to though, and there‚Äôs a public sauna we can go to too, but it‚Äôs not a floating one
30/08/2019, 12:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs irritating but that‚Äôs also the way society is heading; empty promises all around
30/08/2019, 3:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't mind, people are like that everywhere so don't sweat it üòÑ
30/08/2019, 3:49 pm - Stephen Browett: We could do a public one though!
30/08/2019, 3:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Or maybe some kayaking in a fjord instead?
30/08/2019, 3:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, both are options üòä I‚Äôll check out the kayaking! I‚Äôd love to do that too
30/08/2019, 3:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: People are up for the party though üòÇ it‚Äôs free after all
30/08/2019, 3:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha naturally!
30/08/2019, 3:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Exactly üòâüíÉüèºüéâ
30/08/2019, 3:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: It will be nice though, I‚Äôm excited!
30/08/2019, 3:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Me too!
30/08/2019, 3:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Just so you're aware, I'm planning on being a menace during the party üëç
30/08/2019, 3:59 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll be having fun üòù
30/08/2019, 3:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha sure!
30/08/2019, 4:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve told everyone you want to practice your Norwegian that you learnt in Svalbard üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
30/08/2019, 6:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Did you remember to mention that svalbard was 5 years ago and that I've forgotten almost all of it? üòÖ
30/08/2019, 6:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Snakker du engelsk? üòù
30/08/2019, 6:54 pm - Stephen Browett: This is going to go well haha
30/08/2019, 7:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Of course I remember, I just wanted to create an awkward situation for you
30/08/2019, 7:07 pm - Stephen Browett: üëç
30/08/2019, 7:07 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm so glad we're friends üòÇ
30/08/2019, 7:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Me too üòå
08/09/2019, 7:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Friday!! Is it ok if you take the train to Oslo s and that I meet you there?
08/09/2019, 7:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also, do you have free internet in Scandinavia? It would be easier to communicate that way, but we‚Äôll work around it if not üòä
09/09/2019, 1:07 am - Stephen Browett: Is no problem for me to get the train in, I have no idea if I have free Internet though üòÖ
09/09/2019, 1:08 am - Stephen Browett: I'll have to check my contract tomorrow üëç
09/09/2019, 6:41 am - Solveig Andvig: No worries! The airport and train has free WiFi so we should be ok, but it‚Äôs good to know anyway!
09/09/2019, 8:32 pm - Stephen Browett: I have data in Norway! üòÑ Turns out that o2 is a bit of a legend üòù
09/09/2019, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect!
09/09/2019, 8:33 pm - Stephen Browett: How do I book Norwegian trains? I'll get that sorted this evening üòÑ
09/09/2019, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: You do it on the day, you won‚Äôt get cheaper tickets in advance
09/09/2019, 8:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: So the easiest is having the app but you can also just buy it at the station on one of the machines. Just make sure you don‚Äôt choose the ‚Äúflytoget / airport express‚Äù because it‚Äôs the more expensive alternative
09/09/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôll be able to find your way around though, the airport express train is on the right when you arrive, and on the left are the regular trains which you want to take
09/09/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: The app if you want it is called ‚ÄúVy‚Äù
09/09/2019, 10:14 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll take a look, I should probably familiarise myself with the language in the app before I touch down on Norwegian soil and start panicking üòÇ
09/09/2019, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol you‚Äôll be fine!
09/09/2019, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: You can always communicate with me
09/09/2019, 11:51 pm - Stephen Browett: Because your English is phenomenal üòÇ
But yes, don't be too surprised if you get a panicked message saying that I've just passed Gothenburg Station üòÇ
10/09/2019, 5:37 am - Solveig Andvig: Ha! No, that‚Äôs not going to happen üòä
10/09/2019, 5:38 am - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs easy to get to Oslo central station ( Oslo S ), most trains stop there and it‚Äôs announced in English so you‚Äôd be pretty stressed or asleep to miss it
10/09/2019, 5:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Is that a challenge? üòù
10/09/2019, 6:00 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll be alright really lol
10/09/2019, 6:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha I know you will be!
10/09/2019, 9:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: Could you send me the flight time on Friday again please? üòÅüò¨
10/09/2019, 10:18 pm - Stephen Browett: I take off at 3pm and land at 6pm üëç
10/09/2019, 10:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect! Do you have luggage?
11/09/2019, 3:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Just hand luggage, I pack light üòù
11/09/2019, 6:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok, that‚Äôs good then we can see if you‚Äôre too tired to go into town straight away when you arrive
11/09/2019, 6:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: There are various activities happening which could be fun to check out
11/09/2019, 7:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Definitely!
11/09/2019, 7:13 pm - Stephen Browett: When I arrive I'll have been sat down all day and so would love to be out and about just to stretc my legs üòÑ
11/09/2019, 7:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Stretch
11/09/2019, 7:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect! üòÅüòÅ
11/09/2019, 7:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm so excited!
11/09/2019, 7:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Autumn is definitely here so it‚Äôs a little bit chilly so probably good to have a warm jumper but you don‚Äôt need winter clothes
11/09/2019, 7:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: But it‚Äôs also really warm during day time
11/09/2019, 7:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Impossible to dress ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/09/2019, 7:56 pm - Stephen Browett: That's OK, British people have a proud tradition of dressing inappropriately for the weather üòù
11/09/2019, 7:56 pm - Stephen Browett: We're used to being slightly uncomfortable at all times üòÇ
11/09/2019, 8:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh I know
11/09/2019, 8:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Which is why I warned you
11/09/2019, 10:16 pm - Stephen Browett: That's reasonable haha what kind of activities are available on Friday evening then?
12/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you like downtown abbey?
12/09/2019, 3:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs the premiere today!
12/09/2019, 5:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I love Downton Abbey! I'd totally forgotten that the film was coming out!
12/09/2019, 5:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Are you going to watch it?
12/09/2019, 8:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: I want to! Maybe we can consider going to the cinema Sunday evening
12/09/2019, 8:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: At the colloseum or odeon
12/09/2019, 9:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: Just keep me updated about the travel tomorrow üòäI‚Äôm very excited! Also if you have any last minute questions
12/09/2019, 10:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Plan! üòÑ And I probably will have last minute questions üòù
13/09/2019, 5:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Have you landed? üòÅ
13/09/2019, 5:38 pm - Stephen Browett: Jeg er i Norge!!!
13/09/2019, 5:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Wohooo!
13/09/2019, 5:39 pm - Stephen Browett: The train I'm on to central has just left the airport üëç
13/09/2019, 5:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Where's best to meet you? üòÑ
13/09/2019, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Oh!!!
13/09/2019, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll go to the station and meet you
13/09/2019, 5:40 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't hang about haha
13/09/2019, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll keep you updated
13/09/2019, 5:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Cool!
13/09/2019, 5:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Just wait there
13/09/2019, 5:41 pm - Stephen Browett: I can manage that üëç
13/09/2019, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Going out the door now
13/09/2019, 5:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Will take the tram there
13/09/2019, 6:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Are you at the station yet? I‚Äôm there in 3 min
13/09/2019, 6:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Just arrived a minute ago
13/09/2019, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok are you in the main hall?
13/09/2019, 6:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes (probably) üòÅ
13/09/2019, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha good!
13/09/2019, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Just have to fight my way through the crowd now then I‚Äôm there
13/09/2019, 6:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Good luck ü§û
14/09/2019, 11:32 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol they weren‚Äôt ready for me just yet üòÇüòÇ
14/09/2019, 11:39 am - Stephen Browett: We power walked all that way?! üòÇ
14/09/2019, 11:39 am - Solveig Andvig: Yes üò¨üò¨
14/09/2019, 11:39 am - Solveig Andvig: They‚Äôve still not taken me in haha
14/09/2019, 11:39 am - Stephen Browett: That's OK, the lady's in the coffee shop were giving me tips on places to go
14/09/2019, 11:39 am - Solveig Andvig: Perfect!
14/09/2019, 11:39 am - Solveig Andvig: What did she mention?
14/09/2019, 11:39 am - Stephen Browett: They mainly recommended bars though üòÖ
14/09/2019, 11:40 am - Stephen Browett: One said she really liked going out of town to sognsvann for outdoor activities
14/09/2019, 11:40 am - Solveig Andvig: Ah right!
14/09/2019, 11:40 am - Solveig Andvig: Yeah that‚Äôs a nice place üòä
14/09/2019, 11:41 am - Stephen Browett: <Media omitted>
14/09/2019, 11:41 am - Stephen Browett: üòÇ
15/09/2019, 12:14 am - Solveig Andvig: Come to the back!!
15/09/2019, 12:14 am - Solveig Andvig: Behind the bar and dance floor is another dance floor
15/09/2019, 10:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: I will take a ‚Äúno answer‚Äù personally
15/09/2019, 10:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Answer me!!
15/09/2019, 10:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I told you to stop messaging me!
15/09/2019, 10:50 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm calling the police
15/09/2019, 10:50 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò±üò±
15/09/2019, 10:53 pm - Stephen Browett: üöìüöìüöì
16/09/2019, 8:59 am - Solveig Andvig: Also, just give me a call if there‚Äôs anything else you need help with on the journey!
16/09/2019, 9:00 am - Solveig Andvig: (In Norway)
16/09/2019, 9:00 am - Solveig Andvig: üòÅ
16/09/2019, 9:02 am - Stephen Browett: Thank you!
16/09/2019, 9:04 am - Stephen Browett: Although I assume you mean "the journey of life" so I should give you a call whenever I need help at any time, night or day? üëç
16/09/2019, 9:04 am - Stephen Browett: That's very kind and I'll be sure to do that
16/09/2019, 9:04 am - Stephen Browett: Regardless of how inconvenient it might be for you üòÅ
16/09/2019, 9:05 am - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha yes go ahead!
16/09/2019, 9:05 am - Solveig Andvig: üòÇ
16/09/2019, 9:40 am - Stephen Browett: And I've reached the airport with 2.5 hours to spare before my flight. I wish I had those three beers I'd left at yours now  üòÇ
16/09/2019, 9:51 am - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha!!
16/09/2019, 9:51 am - Solveig Andvig: Yes that‚Äôs typical
16/09/2019, 10:00 am - Solveig Andvig: Btw I‚Äôm definitely contacting you again for tips on the data science part! The work you do sounds very cool
16/09/2019, 10:11 am - Stephen Browett: Do it! We can definitely flesh out some ideas and see what we can do
16/09/2019, 10:12 am - Stephen Browett: I can even chat to our dev ops guy about best practices for setting up some cloud based infrastructure (if we need it)
16/09/2019, 10:20 am - Solveig Andvig: Perfect!
16/09/2019, 10:21 am - Solveig Andvig: (If he turns up)
16/09/2019, 10:21 am - Solveig Andvig: Is he straight? In that case, show a photo of me üòÅ
16/09/2019, 10:38 am - Stephen Browett: Hahaha he's about 40 and married with a child
16/09/2019, 10:38 am - Stephen Browett: Unless that sort of thing doesn't deter you? üòù
16/09/2019, 10:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Can still give me an advantage!
16/09/2019, 10:43 am - Solveig Andvig: Don‚Äôt have to act on it
16/09/2019, 10:47 am - Stephen Browett: Haha I'll test the waters out and see what kind of vibe I get from him üòÇ
16/09/2019, 10:48 am - Stephen Browett: He also has some incredibly right-wing opinions (borderline racist and sexist) but you seen keen so I'll put in a good word for you üëç
16/09/2019, 10:48 am - Stephen Browett: You're welcome!
16/09/2019, 11:13 am - Solveig Andvig: Lol!!
16/09/2019, 11:13 am - Solveig Andvig: Thanks
16/09/2019, 11:13 am - Solveig Andvig: Appreciate it
16/09/2019, 7:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: https://www.farandwide.com/s/amazing-world-maps-74d6186e6d0e414b?utm_campaign=amazingworldmaps-cba329a0a08f4557&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=out&aid=008d034cf1b163e30d943e921a0636ed90&utm_term=Guardian+%28Guardian+News+%26+Media+Ltd%29
17/09/2019, 8:37 am - Solveig Andvig: Right, so I‚Äôm going to ask mr. Data scientist üë®‚Äçüî¨ what course I should start with (on your recommendation)
17/09/2019, 1:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Hmm... How good is your python? Maybe start with a general python refresher
17/09/2019, 1:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Afterwards coursera has a bunch of good data science courses
17/09/2019, 1:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok üòÅ
17/09/2019, 8:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Hey! I was pretty busy earlier so I wasn't terribly helpful üòì
17/09/2019, 8:19 pm - Stephen Browett: Here is a reasonable article that describes what kind of skills are useful for a data scientist to have:
https://cvcompiler.com/blog/what-do-companies-expect-from-python-devs-in-2019/
17/09/2019, 8:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Sorry, that one was for a python developer in general
17/09/2019, 8:20 pm - Stephen Browett: This one is for data scientists specifically:

17/09/2019, 8:24 pm - Stephen Browett: But if I was to break it down to the core requirements then (in my limited experience) I'd say that the ability to read in (csv, json or boto3 for data stored in AWS) and handle data (numpy, pandas), perform some complex algorithm (some research into computer science will help out here but there's almost always a python library that does whatever you need) and then visualise your results appropriately (matplotlib, plotly, tableau) is key
17/09/2019, 8:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: What! You‚Äôre so very helpful Steve üòÅ
17/09/2019, 8:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Are these things you learnt mostly during your phd?
17/09/2019, 8:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha it was a bit of a brain dump but I hope that gives you a bit of a direction to start üòÖ
17/09/2019, 8:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely üòä
17/09/2019, 8:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll let you know how it goes
17/09/2019, 8:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Most of them, yeah
17/09/2019, 8:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Mainly I learned how to identify a problem and how to choose the most appropriate solution
17/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Right
17/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Identify a problem I think I can
17/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll stop inundating you with information now üòÇ
17/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: No!
17/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I love it, don‚Äôt stop
17/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: (Sounds very suggestive)
17/09/2019, 8:31 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha steady now! üòÑ
17/09/2019, 8:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbh python is so general that you could be learning it forever
17/09/2019, 8:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Btw definitely use python 3.7 as it's the latest stable version and has some cool features
17/09/2019, 8:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah that much I know üòÅüëåüèº
17/09/2019, 8:34 pm - Stephen Browett: The point is that it might help if you identified what it is you want to develop and just targeted learning modules related to that
17/09/2019, 8:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Which I can help you choose if you like? üòÑ
17/09/2019, 8:34 pm - Stephen Browett: I can show you a bit of my python if you like?
17/09/2019, 8:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahahaha
17/09/2019, 8:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also suggestive
17/09/2019, 8:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Reads kinds gross when it's written down though üòÇ
17/09/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
17/09/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think it‚Äôs fun
17/09/2019, 8:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: British people just being sensitive... you know we love dicks here
17/09/2019, 8:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I‚Äôll try to make more of a plan of what I want to accomplish - I‚Äôll use my idea as a starting point üòÅ
17/09/2019, 8:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: (Gotta start somewhere!)
17/09/2019, 8:42 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha everyone has to have a passion!
17/09/2019, 8:43 pm - Stephen Browett: If you need someone to bounce some ideas off, feel free to drop me a message!
17/09/2019, 8:43 pm - Stephen Browett: In the mean time I have another episode of unbelievable to watch üòÖ
17/09/2019, 8:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hey, I‚Äôd be sleeping around more if it weren‚Äôt for the hygienic and disease risk calculations üòÇüòÇüòÇ
17/09/2019, 8:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Omg yes!! I should too
17/09/2019, 8:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I have told you that I‚Äôm going to pester you with messages
17/09/2019, 8:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'm afraid I'm not much of an expert in this area üòÇ
17/09/2019, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: I think that my track record has shown that I need to be pestered üòÖ
17/09/2019, 9:00 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm trying to be better though!
17/09/2019, 9:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, so far you've done well =)
17/09/2019, 9:13 pm - Stephen Browett: How annoyed would you be if I stopped messaging right at that moment? üòù
17/09/2019, 9:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you really want to test it? Hahaha
17/09/2019, 9:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha I dare not üòÇ
17/09/2019, 9:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: ;)
18/09/2019, 5:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: How far did you get on the series????

18/09/2019, 5:27 pm - Stephen Browett: You're racing ahead! üòÇ
18/09/2019, 5:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve had a tough day ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ need simple entertainment
18/09/2019, 5:28 pm - Stephen Browett: There's no judgement here haha
18/09/2019, 5:28 pm - Stephen Browett: I thought episode 3 was a bit confusing. They've discovered another victim?
18/09/2019, 5:28 pm - Stephen Browett: But haven't yet tied in the girl we saw in episode one?
18/09/2019, 5:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hmm... that‚Äôs what you say
18/09/2019, 5:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Going to work on my projects but later I think
18/09/2019, 5:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Who's now being sued for wasting police time?
18/09/2019, 5:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÇ
18/09/2019, 5:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes

18/09/2019, 5:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Let me know how your projects go!
18/09/2019, 5:31 pm - Stephen Browett: And if you want a second pair of eyes /hands, let me know üòÖ
18/09/2019, 5:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: Will do üòÅ and I will take you up on it
18/09/2019, 5:57 pm - Stephen Browett: üëå

19/09/2019, 4:39 pm - Stephen Browett: Don't you have work? üòÇ
19/09/2019, 4:39 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm still on the 4th episode!
19/09/2019, 4:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ

19/09/2019, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha you've nailed those
19/09/2019, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Hmm... Also too many for me to binge in one night...
19/09/2019, 5:50 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm afraid we're going to have to wait before we can talk about this üòÖ
19/09/2019, 7:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò¨üò¨
19/09/2019, 7:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôre basically telling me I don‚Äôt have a life üò≠
19/09/2019, 7:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: Which is true because I am down with a cold and am bored
19/09/2019, 7:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I slept for the last 4 hours
19/09/2019, 8:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh dang! Maybe I brought over some foreign disease? üòù
19/09/2019, 8:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think I did this to myself
19/09/2019, 8:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Been partying too hard and now my body lets me suffer as a payback
19/09/2019, 8:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha as long as the partying was worth it üòù
19/09/2019, 8:12 pm - Stephen Browett: I think your body is just making sure that you have a relaxing weekend this weekend üòÇ
19/09/2019, 8:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely... Unfortunately there's too much going on and I don't want to say "no" to some of these things
19/09/2019, 8:17 pm - Stephen Browett: You going to be a live model in the park this weekend? üòù
19/09/2019, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Dagny's friend is having a moving-in-party and I've just gotten to know her and she insisted on me coming... Don't want to be rude and say no when I've never been.
19/09/2019, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: it's not on this weekend!
19/09/2019, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: otherwise I might have tried it ;)
19/09/2019, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: you jealous?
19/09/2019, 8:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Of the party or live modelling?
19/09/2019, 8:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Live modelling
19/09/2019, 8:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Actually, I'm jealous of both üòù
19/09/2019, 8:53 pm - Stephen Browett: I'd have gone live modelling with you!
19/09/2019, 8:54 pm - Stephen Browett: We could have done some yoga or something, the people drawing would iave loved that
19/09/2019, 8:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Nooooo, I should have known this when you arrived!
19/09/2019, 8:54 pm - Stephen Browett: If I could hold the yoga pose for any amount of time haha
19/09/2019, 8:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: haha, keeping the pose for an hour would be difficult but good exercise
19/09/2019, 8:54 pm - Stephen Browett: I think my leg muscles would probably explode üòÖ
19/09/2019, 8:55 pm - Stephen Browett: But I'm a terrible drawer so I'm definitely better off being drawn
19/09/2019, 8:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Mostly because I'm beautiful ofc üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇ
19/09/2019, 8:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: I am still keen on having someone make a sculpture of myself naked
19/09/2019, 9:02 pm - Stephen Browett: I didn't know this?
19/09/2019, 9:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Would you display it in your house?
19/09/2019, 9:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: of course!
19/09/2019, 9:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: but people wouldn't be able to recognise me
19/09/2019, 9:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: unless they've seen me naked ;)
19/09/2019, 9:03 pm - Stephen Browett: So you'd have the sculpture headless or something?
19/09/2019, 9:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: probably just the head less detailed
19/09/2019, 9:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: in whatever elegant way that could be done
19/09/2019, 9:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Fair, gotta keep the details on the business haha
19/09/2019, 9:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: yes ;)
19/09/2019, 9:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: hahah
19/09/2019, 9:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: though, now that I've told people they will always wonder if it's me if I have such a thing in my home
19/09/2019, 9:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Then you should buy a statue from the shops to mess with people!
19/09/2019, 9:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Leave it out and see who notices it üòÇ
19/09/2019, 9:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: exactly
19/09/2019, 9:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: just have to make sure it looks amazing regardless
19/09/2019, 9:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: BTW, you're doing great in replying to messages now!
19/09/2019, 9:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's a completely new experience talking to you now ;)
20/09/2019, 7:55 am - Stephen Browett: Haha is that some sass you're sending my way? üòù
20/09/2019, 7:55 am - Stephen Browett: I'm glad it's making a difference though üòÑ
20/09/2019, 8:16 am - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm glad you think I have the personality to pull off sass
20/09/2019, 1:13 pm - Stephen Browett: You definitely do, you were giving me so much sass last Sunday
20/09/2019, 1:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Which I totally deserved üòÖ
20/09/2019, 1:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha nice üòé
20/09/2019, 1:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I‚Äôm sure you liked it too
20/09/2019, 8:23 pm - Stephen Browett: I do like a good bit of chat üòÑ
20/09/2019, 8:23 pm - Stephen Browett: And I give enough of it out that it would be unfair if I couldn't take it in return
20/09/2019, 8:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Btw I watched episodes 4 and 5 of unbelievable last night
20/09/2019, 8:23 pm - Stephen Browett: So good!
20/09/2019, 8:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: yeah, right??
20/09/2019, 8:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm glad we started watching it!
20/09/2019, 8:27 pm - Stephen Browett: They've just identified a police officer who fits the profile of the attacker
20/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: dun dun dun dun
20/09/2019, 8:28 pm - Stephen Browett: Also, the drawing of the attacker that the hippie girl gives the police is hilarious üòÇ
20/09/2019, 8:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: hahaha yes

20/09/2019, 8:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: so what do you think? is she lying?
20/09/2019, 9:56 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't know... What would she be lying about though?
20/09/2019, 10:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: üôà
20/09/2019, 10:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Spoilers!

20/09/2019, 10:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ

22/09/2019, 8:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: it is one of my all-time favourite shows and I know people from the Netherlands and the UK who have loved it too

23/09/2019, 6:07 pm - Stephen Browett: The trailer looks really funny in places too
23/09/2019, 6:07 pm - Stephen Browett: I've got two episodes of unbelievable left then I'll start on this üòù
23/09/2019, 6:08 pm - Stephen Browett: I wish I had more recommendations for you buy the shows I like are mostly documentaries üòÖ

23/09/2019, 6:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Is that on Netflix or do I have to dust off my now tv account for that one?
23/09/2019, 6:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: HBO üò¨
23/09/2019, 9:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: Lol did you know the series unbelievable we started watching last Sunday had premiere the Friday before? I finished it in only a few days üòÇ
24/09/2019, 12:34 am - Stephen Browett: üòÇ It is good tbf. I've only got the last episode to go! They found the guy!
24/09/2019, 12:34 am - Stephen Browett: A couple of things seem off though...
24/09/2019, 12:35 am - Stephen Browett: Like, the victims said the attacker was sensitive at times... This guy seems super gruff, I can't imagine him being sensitive
24/09/2019, 12:35 am - Stephen Browett: And if like to see how they tie in the girl from Washington
24/09/2019, 2:58 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha well you‚Äôll have to see üòâ

25/09/2019, 5:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Unless you're secretly his best mate and you guys have been chatting away üòù
25/09/2019, 5:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haven‚Äôt spoken to him since 2013 üòÇüòÇ
25/09/2019, 5:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Clearly he's been thinking of you üòú
25/09/2019, 7:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes he‚Äôs been stalking my profile a few times actually without doing anything but now he found it appropriate to endorse me

28/09/2019, 9:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: Big spoon... I don‚Äôt normally like it but he‚Äôs a complete diva so I didn‚Äôt have much of a choice
28/09/2019, 9:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: I love adventures! What do you have in mind?
29/09/2019, 9:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Don‚Äôt ignore me :(((((
29/09/2019, 9:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Sozzles! I didn't have anything in mind, I was just wondering what to look for while I Google holidays
29/09/2019, 9:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well the finish sauna is definitely something to experience
29/09/2019, 9:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: And maybe they have a cool igloo or something to sleep in
29/09/2019, 9:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I know you‚Äôve seen the northern lights and all, but I‚Äôve never experienced it properly so depending on when we‚Äôre going that might be cool to consider - on snowmobiles!
29/09/2019, 9:42 pm - Solveig Andvig: https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions/finland-sf.htm
29/09/2019, 9:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes! That would be so cool!
29/09/2019, 9:46 pm - Stephen Browett: Ride around on snow mobiles during the day then watch the northern lights from a little glass roofed room by night!
29/09/2019, 9:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes!! Sounds like a dream
29/09/2019, 9:47 pm - Stephen Browett: Basically the picture you just sent me in Instagram is exactly what I had in mind! üòÑ
29/09/2019, 9:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: Great minds think alike ;)
29/09/2019, 9:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: We could look at renting a car too
29/09/2019, 9:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to drive there but I would guess much like Norway
29/09/2019, 9:53 pm - Stephen Browett: That would mean you'd better drive üòù
29/09/2019, 9:53 pm - Stephen Browett: If it gets snowy at all I promise I will crash the car üòÇ
29/09/2019, 9:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha I‚Äôll do the driving then!
29/09/2019, 9:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm used to it
29/09/2019, 9:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Depends on what we want to do if we need one though
29/09/2019, 10:14 pm - Stephen Browett: True true!
29/09/2019, 10:14 pm - Stephen Browett: When can we go?
29/09/2019, 10:14 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm free anytime in November
30/09/2019, 6:58 am - Solveig Andvig: Maybe last week of November? I‚Äôll have to check with work though, I have an operation mid-November which means I‚Äôm out of work for a week most likely...
30/09/2019, 1:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh no! Nothing serious I hope?
30/09/2019, 2:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not as in I will die if I don‚Äôt have it but most likely serious enough that it will affect my health and reproduction possibilities if I don‚Äôt do anything
30/09/2019, 4:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Ah yeah, you told me when I came to visit. If the holiday is going to be too soon after the operation then we could delay?
30/09/2019, 5:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you have any available time in December at all?
30/09/2019, 7:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, 7th-8th or 14th-15th weekends are good
30/09/2019, 7:40 pm - Stephen Browett: As long as Finland doesn't get too expensive around Christmas
30/09/2019, 8:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: That‚Äôs true!
30/09/2019, 8:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Let‚Äôs check out some of the prices
30/09/2019, 8:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you have any additional holiday left to use other than the weekend?
30/09/2019, 8:38 pm - Stephen Browett: I have 5.5 days left to use
30/09/2019, 9:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha perfect, and how many do you want to use on this holiday?
30/09/2019, 9:12 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbh I'm happy using all of them üòÇ
30/09/2019, 9:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yay!
30/09/2019, 9:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: I only have four so that‚Äôs my limit unfortunately haha
30/09/2019, 9:20 pm - Stephen Browett: 4 sounds good to me!
30/09/2019, 9:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect, I‚Äôll look at some more details tomorrow as I have to go to bed very soon
30/09/2019, 9:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll send you what I find :-)
30/09/2019, 9:26 pm - Stephen Browett: Sounds good, I'll take a look as well üòÑ
30/09/2019, 9:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good! Just send me stuff if you find something you‚Äôre interested in
01/10/2019, 8:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: I fell asleep and haven‚Äôt been able to do any research yet! Sorryyy - will try again tomorrow
02/10/2019, 3:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok so I spent some spare time in work to browse some of the activities
02/10/2019, 3:22 pm - Solveig Andvig: I would love to do the igloo, northern lights, skiing and sledging but it‚Äôs quite far away from Helsinki
02/10/2019, 3:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôll check out the transportation methods if it‚Äôs feasible otherwise it might be worth considering a different country / experience so we don‚Äôt ‚Äúwaste‚Äù time sitting on a train or in a car all the time
02/10/2019, 3:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: What do you think?
02/10/2019, 3:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: And prices might go up in December as you mentioned but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll get time off in November :-(
02/10/2019, 4:02 pm - Stephen Browett: It's probably less exotic for you but I'm sure tromso will have activities like those but also has an airport üëå
02/10/2019, 4:02 pm - Stephen Browett: If we decide it's too hard to get to Northern Finland of course
02/10/2019, 4:03 pm - Stephen Browett: But if we're going for a few days then spending a couple of hours on a train/coach isn't too much of a big deal
02/10/2019, 4:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Imho
02/10/2019, 4:04 pm - Stephen Browett: A mate of mine went to luosto in Finland which he said was good but I've not looked it up myself yet
02/10/2019, 4:04 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll take a look later
02/10/2019, 4:05 pm - Stephen Browett: I would like it to be reasonably cheap as I've had a few big expenses over the last couple of months üòÖ
02/10/2019, 4:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes agreed!
02/10/2019, 4:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Troms√∏ is also an option but less exotic yes ;)
02/10/2019, 4:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôve never been though
04/10/2019, 7:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: How are you?
04/10/2019, 8:43 pm - Stephen Browett: Tired üòÖ
04/10/2019, 8:44 pm - Stephen Browett: My junior started this week and training her has taken all of my time and energy üòù
04/10/2019, 8:45 pm - Stephen Browett: She's really good though, there's just a lot of information she needs to learn!
04/10/2019, 8:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs temporary so you‚Äôll survive ;) and it‚Äôs good she‚Äôs living up to expectations!
04/10/2019, 8:53 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah! üòÑ
04/10/2019, 8:53 pm - Stephen Browett: How are things with you?
04/10/2019, 8:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Tired too but more from doing nothing haha
04/10/2019, 8:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm feeling very restless these dats
04/10/2019, 8:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Days
04/10/2019, 8:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh yeah? Do you feel like you need to change things up a bit?
04/10/2019, 8:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: At the moment I don‚Äôt know what I want
04/10/2019, 8:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: Other than that I should be doing more with my life
04/10/2019, 10:13 pm - Stephen Browett: How would you like to be doing more?
04/10/2019, 10:13 pm - Stephen Browett: As in, for social good or personal /professional development or something else?
04/10/2019, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good question,,, I think both now that you‚Äôve mentioned it
04/10/2019, 11:10 pm - Stephen Browett: Well you could certainly try to tackle one of those at a time
04/10/2019, 11:10 pm - Stephen Browett: How did your project ideas go?
05/10/2019, 7:21 am - Solveig Andvig: They went well until I got restless and wanted to move abroad and started doubting myself whether or not I‚Äôm doing the right thing
05/10/2019, 7:21 am - Solveig Andvig: It feels like it‚Äôs going to tie me down a lot which is scary for someone who‚Äôs longing to feel free
05/10/2019, 7:23 am - Solveig Andvig: I haven‚Äôt thrown the ideas out the window, last night I was back doing research for it again, but I don‚Äôt know why I get these sudden impulses of doubt... maybe that‚Äôs a good thing?
05/10/2019, 10:14 am - Stephen Browett: If it makes you have a reality check every now and again then it's definitely a good thing
05/10/2019, 10:15 am - Stephen Browett: You could try just doing the quick and dirty solution to the projects just so you can look at it and decide if it's something you want to go back and do properly
05/10/2019, 1:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha but what is a quick and dirty solution to them? Just see if the concept works? I need to convince my mum to invest in it then
05/10/2019, 1:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: I did start brushing up on my programming knowledge though
05/10/2019, 1:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm never any good at reporting on my actual progress until I‚Äôm done
05/10/2019, 1:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I want to move on to build my own iot device, maybe for the plants we already have
05/10/2019, 1:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
05/10/2019, 1:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Did a nice walk today
05/10/2019, 3:07 pm - Stephen Browett: That looks amazing!
05/10/2019, 3:07 pm - Stephen Browett: You should've taken me when I was over üòÇ
05/10/2019, 3:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Need something to trick you into coming back ;)
05/10/2019, 3:16 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha it won't take much
05/10/2019, 3:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect! When‚Äôs the next time you‚Äôre coming back? :D
05/10/2019, 4:12 pm - Stephen Browett: I've got no plans in 2 week's time üòÖ
05/10/2019, 4:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha
05/10/2019, 4:13 pm - Stephen Browett: I better save up a bit more money, the last visit out a bit of a dent in my wallet üòÖ
05/10/2019, 4:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ahh yes, it is rather expensive here :-(
05/10/2019, 4:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôll fix that by moving here - the jobs pay well ;)
05/10/2019, 4:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: But we are supposed to plan the holiday to Finland or somewhere else?
05/10/2019, 9:32 pm - Stephen Browett: It wasn't that big of a dent lol
05/10/2019, 9:33 pm - Stephen Browett: I was just exaggerating üòÅ
05/10/2019, 9:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Have we decided when we're able to go holiday?
06/10/2019, 8:42 am - Solveig Andvig: Just being a typical Brit and complaining about everything ;)
06/10/2019, 8:44 am - Solveig Andvig: I think December is the best for me, but I‚Äôll see if I can have a chat with my boss to hear his thoughts this coming week. He has been out of office...
06/10/2019, 8:44 am - Solveig Andvig: An alternative is to postpone it to January and that I ask to have the days transferred to next year? Don‚Äôt know if that possible for you or even interesting?
06/10/2019, 12:25 pm - Stephen Browett: I can rollover my leave to next year so that's definitely an option!
06/10/2019, 12:26 pm - Stephen Browett: It might make it a bit easier to sort out as well to give ourselves an extra month before we plan on leaving?
06/10/2019, 1:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: Absolutely and less stress in terms of workload for me :-)
06/10/2019, 1:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: If we do that I think we should aim for something more exciting than Finland though? What do you think?
10/10/2019, 2:48 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
10/10/2019, 4:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'll remember that for when I'm making my next video üòù
10/10/2019, 4:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Your next???
10/10/2019, 4:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Where are the old ones? ü§≠
10/10/2019, 7:50 pm - Stephen Browett: Wouldn't you like to know? üòâ
10/10/2019, 7:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: üôà
10/10/2019, 7:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Don‚Äôt make me blush
10/10/2019, 7:51 pm - Solveig Andvig: Anyway, my operation was moved to tomorrow so you have to wish me good luck!
10/10/2019, 8:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Aah! Good luck! üçÄ
10/10/2019, 8:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Are you nervous?
10/10/2019, 8:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah
10/10/2019, 8:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò¨üò¨
10/10/2019, 8:52 pm - Stephen Browett: The doctors will have performed the operation hundreds of times before, you'll be fine! üòÑ
10/10/2019, 8:52 pm - Solveig Andvig: üôÉ
10/10/2019, 8:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don‚Äôt follow reason now haha
11/10/2019, 4:27 pm - Stephen Browett: How are you doing?
11/10/2019, 4:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Hope everything went well?
11/10/2019, 4:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm alright thanks üòä no complications
11/10/2019, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: Yay! Any follow-up consultations?
11/10/2019, 4:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah they‚Äôll call me on Monday but nothing other than that
11/10/2019, 4:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: I can‚Äôt shower for two days and can‚Äôt swim in a pool for three weeks
11/10/2019, 4:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: And I can rock out some badass scars in my bikini next time there‚Äôs an opportunity for that
11/10/2019, 5:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Noice üëå
11/10/2019, 5:02 pm - Stephen Browett: You'll look so metal ü§ò
11/10/2019, 5:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha yes
11/10/2019, 5:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: I‚Äôm out on a slow walk to loosen up and speed up recovery now
11/10/2019, 5:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Don't push too hard, sitting still also helps recovery
11/10/2019, 5:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Do you feel sore or stiff or anything after coming out?
11/10/2019, 5:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: They said that the co2 has the pumped in is going to put pressure on my neck which I‚Äôm feeling and the only way to get rid of it is wait and move around
11/10/2019, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: So they recommend a slow 10-15 min walk every morning and evening just to get some exercise
11/10/2019, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: And more if I feel like I can do it but I‚Äôve started very slow so this is only a 15 min one
11/10/2019, 5:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: I will rest later though, don‚Äôt worry üòä I‚Äôve been keeping still all day already
11/10/2019, 5:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: The anaesthetic only kept me out for an hour so I‚Äôm pretty tired
11/10/2019, 5:08 pm - Stephen Browett: The co2 they pumped in is going to put pressure on your neck? What did they do to you?! üòÇ
11/10/2019, 5:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah
11/10/2019, 5:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think it‚Äôs a never or something
11/10/2019, 5:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not sure but they fill the stomach with gas to get space
11/10/2019, 5:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: They deflate as much as they can but most of the time some is left
11/10/2019, 5:12 pm - Stephen Browett: So you've been burping all efternoon? üòù
11/10/2019, 5:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: lol no haha
11/10/2019, 5:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs going through the pores
11/10/2019, 5:19 pm - Stephen Browett: That's cool, I had no idea the stomach could do that!
11/10/2019, 5:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
11/10/2019, 5:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Nice socks üëå
11/10/2019, 5:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Are you still in hospital now?
11/10/2019, 6:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: No that‚Äôs from earlier
11/10/2019, 6:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: At my mums house now
11/10/2019, 6:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not allowed to be alone the first night because of the medication I got
11/10/2019, 6:03 pm - Stephen Browett: Well I hope you got to keep them, they look well snazzy üòú
11/10/2019, 6:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha no but I stole the panties I wore
11/10/2019, 6:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
11/10/2019, 6:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Phwoar!
11/10/2019, 6:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: I get all the guys wearing those
11/10/2019, 6:04 pm - Stephen Browett: They're... Graphic... üòù
11/10/2019, 6:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know, right?
11/10/2019, 6:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: It‚Äôs almost like a French opening
11/10/2019, 6:05 pm - Stephen Browett: I have no idea what that is but I'm scared that if you send a picture someone will see my phone üòÖ
11/10/2019, 6:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you not??
11/10/2019, 6:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok I‚Äôll explain
11/10/2019, 6:05 pm - Stephen Browett: It may surprise you to know that I'm not very fashion focused üòù
11/10/2019, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha it‚Äôs not fashion üòâ
11/10/2019, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: The french opening is for the french kiss a man gives a woman
11/10/2019, 6:06 pm - Solveig Andvig: Basically it‚Äôs panties with an opening ‚Äúdown there‚Äù for easy access with the mouth üòÖ
11/10/2019, 6:07 pm - Stephen Browett: So more like an Australian kiss?
11/10/2019, 6:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Like a French kids but "down under" üòÇ
11/10/2019, 6:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes except no kids involved ü§≠
11/10/2019, 6:09 pm - Stephen Browett: Well that's horrifying...
11/10/2019, 6:09 pm - Stephen Browett: I apologise üòÇ
11/10/2019, 6:09 pm - Stephen Browett: But I have a pair of boxers like that but only because they're super old and the home was worn in...
11/10/2019, 6:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Steve!
11/10/2019, 6:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Honestly you can‚Äôt keep boxers like that
11/10/2019, 6:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Guys have as much responsibility to dress in nice underwear as women
11/10/2019, 6:11 pm - Stephen Browett: You sound like every other person I've told that to!
11/10/2019, 6:11 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe there's some truth to what you're saying... üòù
11/10/2019, 6:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah good
11/10/2019, 6:12 pm - Solveig Andvig: If I was there I‚Äôd throw it out whether you wanted me to or not
11/10/2019, 6:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: And if you put up a fight I might accidentally throw it out the window ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
11/10/2019, 6:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: But hey, not everyone knows how to dress great üòâüòå
11/10/2019, 6:14 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha that's a good point, I'm not taking fashion advice from someone with those socks and pants ü§£
11/10/2019, 6:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§®ü§®ü§®
11/10/2019, 6:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: Excuse me??
11/10/2019, 6:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: My own socks and pants are amazing!
11/10/2019, 6:25 pm - Solveig Andvig: The socks say ‚Äúzero (picture of a fox) given‚Äù in happy colours
11/10/2019, 6:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha OK, fair enough. I'll take your advices üëç
11/10/2019, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÅ
11/10/2019, 8:17 pm - Solveig Andvig: You‚Äôre so easy to convince
11/10/2019, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: I should have you as my minion
11/10/2019, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: ‚ÄúSteve, I need a massage‚Äù
11/10/2019, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: ‚ÄúSteve, I need a new purse‚Äù
11/10/2019, 8:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: ‚ÄúSteve, we should go to the theatre‚Äù
12/10/2019, 1:11 am - Stephen Browett: First of all, I love the theatre üòÑ

17/10/2019, 5:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: I know, considering the amount of verbal abuse I'm getting you'd think I'd thrown you out of my friend circle a long time ago üòâ

18/10/2019, 5:21 pm - Solveig Andvig: Please do! I won't bother you while on holiday so if you forget to keep on touch... You know what happens üôÄ
18/10/2019, 5:24 pm - Stephen Browett: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 5:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Just had a lot on at work: two clients want to go live within a week of each other and our dev ops guy has just been pretty much sacked
18/10/2019, 5:25 pm - Stephen Browett: Drama!
18/10/2019, 5:25 pm - Stephen Browett: And I don't _do_ drama

18/10/2019, 5:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: I remember you told me about him - probably for the better but inconvenient timing... Sometimes it's needed though and you'll be able to get through it. I thought you were a very relaxed guy, why feeling so stressed about something completely out of your control?
18/10/2019, 5:28 pm - Solveig Andvig: Good attitude ‚úåüèª leave the drama behind and let someone else handle it
18/10/2019, 5:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>

18/10/2019, 5:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha I'll have a pint or two tonight then I'll feel much better üòÅüçª
18/10/2019, 5:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounds good üòÅ maybe go and dance?
18/10/2019, 5:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe! As long as the drink is cheap! (priorities)
18/10/2019, 5:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Have a good trip anyway and send my regards to john and suhayl üíÉ

20/10/2019, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 4:36 pm - Stephen Browett: I saw this in an art museum and it made me think of you üòÅüëç
20/10/2019, 5:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah thanks! At least you're thinking of me üò≥ü§©
20/10/2019, 8:54 pm - Stephen Browett: You're welcome (couldn't help it) üòÑ
20/10/2019, 9:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha I love it - made me smile üòâ are you enjoying yourself?
20/10/2019, 9:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah! üòÑ We've done some sight seeing today and now we're planning on going to an ice hockey game (apparently that's big over here) and the Belarus circus
20/10/2019, 9:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounds like fun! I like hockey games üòÅ
20/10/2019, 9:37 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha you Norwegians, you like anything to do with snow or ice üòù
20/10/2019, 9:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: Obviously üòÅ
20/10/2019, 9:38 pm - Solveig Andvig: You can come and watch skiing and ice skating here if I can watch the rugby in the UK!
20/10/2019, 9:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Yes! That'd be amazing!!
20/10/2019, 9:41 pm - Stephen Browett: Well go and watch some 6 nations live next year! üòÑ

20/10/2019, 10:04 pm - Stephen Browett: We'll watch a good match, not Italy vs Ireland or something like that which will just be Italy getting murdered üòÇ
20/10/2019, 10:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Wales vs England? Or Wales Vs New Zealand?
20/10/2019, 10:13 pm - Stephen Browett: New Zealand isn't in the 6 nations but there are autumn international games where they come up to play a few friendlies
20/10/2019, 10:14 pm - Stephen Browett: If you wanted to see New Zealand play that is
20/10/2019, 10:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ahhh
20/10/2019, 10:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: Well let's do England Vs Wales then?
20/10/2019, 10:15 pm - Solveig Andvig: Or do you have any better suggestions? ‚ò∫ Normally when it comes to sports I prefer to play but rugby is fun to watch!
20/10/2019, 10:21 pm - Stephen Browett: England are playing Wales and Ireland at Twickenham which will be big matches but will also be super expensive
20/10/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: Unless we went to the principality stadium to watch one of Wales' other matches or Murrayfield to watch one of Scotland's games?
20/10/2019, 10:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes... Maybe Wales or Scotland matches then?
21/10/2019, 9:17 pm - Stephen Browett: There's Scotland vs England on the 8th of Feb maybe?
21/10/2019, 9:17 pm - Stephen Browett: John and rosy from the house have said that they're both keen to go üòÑ
21/10/2019, 9:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: sure!
21/10/2019, 9:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: is that in edinburgh? easier for me to get there than to wales!
21/10/2019, 9:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, that's in Edinburgh
21/10/2019, 9:30 pm - Stephen Browett: We can go for some drinks afterwards and stop over! üòÑ
21/10/2019, 9:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: We should :)
24/10/2019, 7:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: David is getting ahead of you learning Norwegian
25/10/2019, 7:38 am - Stephen Browett: Neiiii!
25/10/2019, 7:39 am - Stephen Browett: Tbf if he is actively learning Norwegian then he'll definitely be getting ahead of me üòÖ
25/10/2019, 8:23 am - Solveig Andvig: That's the right response üëåüèº
25/10/2019, 11:35 am - Stephen Browett: The correct number of 'i's as well? üòù
25/10/2019, 11:44 am - Solveig Andvig: If you want to drag it out then yes hahaha
25/10/2019, 11:45 am - Solveig Andvig: It's not grammatically correct but it's how we would text each other
25/10/2019, 11:52 am - Solveig Andvig: Are you back from your holiday now?
25/10/2019, 12:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Not just yet, on my way to country number 3! üòÑ

25/10/2019, 1:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Both of which are amazing
25/10/2019, 1:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Now we're on our way to Riga in Latvia
25/10/2019, 1:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Via a 4 hour coach ride üòÖ
25/10/2019, 1:30 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sounds great! I've never been to any of these places üò¨
25/10/2019, 1:31 pm - Solveig Andvig: 4 hours coach ride sounds ok with the good company of your best friends?
25/10/2019, 3:11 pm - Stephen Browett: We left booking it really late so we're not sitting together üòÖ
25/10/2019, 3:12 pm - Stephen Browett: It's OK though I've got some epic tunes to keep me going
25/10/2019, 3:12 pm - Stephen Browett: How are you doing anyway? You still off work?
25/10/2019, 4:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm doing better thanks ‚ò∫ I'm back in work! And the scars are looking more like acrual scars now - still a bit sore
25/10/2019, 5:42 pm - Stephen Browett: They sound like they're pretty good scars. You'll have to make up a different story every time someone asks how you got them
25/10/2019, 5:43 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't know how big they are, do you reckon you could claim it was a shark attack? üòù
25/10/2019, 5:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: lol no, they
25/10/2019, 5:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: they're not big!
25/10/2019, 5:43 pm - Solveig Andvig: probably 2 cm or something hahah
25/10/2019, 5:45 pm - Stephen Browett: Oh Haha üòÇ
25/10/2019, 5:45 pm - Stephen Browett: A really tiny shark?
25/10/2019, 5:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: baby shark!
25/10/2019, 5:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: du-du-dudududu
25/10/2019, 5:46 pm - Solveig Andvig: I don't think people will dare to ask what the scars are from to be honest
25/10/2019, 6:02 pm - Stephen Browett: That is absolutely something I would ask üòÖ
25/10/2019, 6:02 pm - Stephen Browett: Only if it's a good'n though
25/10/2019, 6:02 pm - Stephen Browett: If that makes it any less weird? üòÇ
25/10/2019, 6:03 pm - Solveig Andvig: You're not most people üòâ and you can interpret that any way you like!
28/10/2019, 5:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 6:18 pm - Stephen Browett: He looks like he needs a hug üòÖ

28/10/2019, 6:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha is this a thinly veiled attempt to get me back over? üòù
28/10/2019, 6:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Because its working
28/10/2019, 6:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes üò≥üò≥
28/10/2019, 6:24 pm - Solveig Andvig: And an excuse to get another hug! Hahah
28/10/2019, 7:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Only one? I'm not sure when that photo was taken but I've added interest since then üòÇ
28/10/2019, 7:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: You'll end up having to ask me to stop üôÉ
28/10/2019, 7:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha as long as we still get to go outside at some point üòù
28/10/2019, 7:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>

28/10/2019, 8:04 pm - Stephen Browett: John and suhayl fancy doing sweden and Norway so the three of us might be coming over!
28/10/2019, 8:05 pm - Solveig Andvig: That would be great! Will you stop by Oslo?
28/10/2019, 8:06 pm - Stephen Browett: Definitely!
28/10/2019, 8:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Well probably fly out to Copenhagen then get the train to Stockholm then Oslo
28/10/2019, 8:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Spending a couple of days at each place
28/10/2019, 8:07 pm - Stephen Browett: Probably, we still need to book it yet
28/10/2019, 8:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: sounds good!
28/10/2019, 8:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: let me know the dates when you have them so I know I am in town :D
28/10/2019, 9:56 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah! üòÑ
28/10/2019, 9:57 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe we could go on one of those hikes you said you wanted to do when I was last there? Leave suhayl and John to go around the museums in Oslo üòÜ
28/10/2019, 10:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: Of course, but there may be snow around Easter time... In that case you have another excuse to visit again ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
28/10/2019, 11:27 pm - Stephen Browett: Pfft you said that there may be snow when I came over last month but I never felt the need to wear anything other than a thin hoodie
28/10/2019, 11:27 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't think it does snow in Oslo üòù
29/10/2019, 5:46 am - Solveig Andvig: You may be right, oslo is milder than the areas around and the weather forecast predicts a mild and wet winter so maybe we never get any snow üòÖ
29/10/2019, 5:46 am - Solveig Andvig: In that case we'll go for that walk ‚ò∫
30/10/2019, 6:07 pm - Solveig Andvig: Apparently I'm coming to Birmingham May next year for a seminar!
30/10/2019, 6:08 pm - Solveig Andvig: You don't happen to have a spear sofa or something? üò¨
30/10/2019, 6:52 pm - Stephen Browett: Amazing! I will absolutely have a sofa for you! üòÑ
30/10/2019, 6:53 pm - Stephen Browett: But only for a couple of days because, you know, you'll overstay your welcome üòù
30/10/2019, 6:54 pm - Stephen Browett: I have no idea where I'll be living at the time though (as in it'll be either Redditch or Birmingham)
30/10/2019, 9:59 pm - Solveig Andvig: üò≥üò≥üò≥
30/10/2019, 10:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I was initially going to suggest that you stay for much longer than your conference but thought that was a bit keen so I went totally the opposite way with it üòÖ
30/10/2019, 10:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I have regrets now!
30/10/2019, 10:32 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha I was thinking I should stay longer since I first came to visit Birmingham üòÅ

30/10/2019, 10:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Then we should go to the rooftop bar in the city centre!
30/10/2019, 10:35 pm - Stephen Browett: May is too far away, I'm getting too excited!
30/10/2019, 10:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahah we're supposed to meet up a few times before that though! We really need to find time to have a chat and plan it otherwise it won't happen ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
30/10/2019, 10:39 pm - Solveig Andvig: And the activities you mention sound great üòÅ
30/10/2019, 11:13 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, we need to get Finland organised if you're still keen?
30/10/2019, 11:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Get one of those glass roofed huts booked so hopefully we see some northern lights and we can go and do some day activities!
30/10/2019, 11:18 pm - Stephen Browett: And I'll get 6 nation tickets once they're on sale üëç
31/10/2019, 5:52 am - Solveig Andvig: I'm still keen on both Finland and rugby üòÅ
31/10/2019, 12:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you have time for a Skype call this weekend?
31/10/2019, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe üòù
31/10/2019, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll be able to give you a certain answer tomorrow evening
31/10/2019, 5:49 pm - Stephen Browett: (weekends are usually my busy time)
31/10/2019, 5:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: ü§≠
31/10/2019, 6:01 pm - Stephen Browett: Why are you giggling?
31/10/2019, 6:47 pm - Solveig Andvig: No, I'm shocked you can't make time for me ü•∫
02/11/2019, 4:16 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll be free to chat tomorrow evening around dinner time if you're about?
02/11/2019, 4:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: I should be :)
02/11/2019, 4:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: Just drop me a message and I'll make time
02/11/2019, 4:23 pm - Stephen Browett: What a legend, I appreciate you making the time ‚ò∫
03/11/2019, 6:05 pm - Stephen Browett: Hey! I'm just about to get some dinner. Would you be free for a call in about an hour or two?
03/11/2019, 6:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yep ‚ò∫
03/11/2019, 6:11 pm - Solveig Andvig: Just give me a ring when you're ready!
03/11/2019, 6:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: I was reminiscing about the old days while looking through my FB photos and this came up:
03/11/2019, 6:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 6:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: There are too many photos of me wearing a scarf on my head on FB üòÖ
03/11/2019, 8:37 pm - Solveig Andvig: It's close to bedtime for me now üò¨ think we'll have to postpone the chat!
09/11/2019, 8:08 am - Solveig Andvig: Have you got any response to what games would be interesting to watch for the rugby?
10/11/2019, 2:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Ok I know I am having a monologue here which is a bit sad but HAVE YOU SEEN "HIS DARK MATERIALS"???
10/11/2019, 8:40 pm - Stephen Browett: I have not and I just realised tonight that I've now missed the second episode as well üòÖ
10/11/2019, 8:40 pm - Stephen Browett: Is it good?
10/11/2019, 8:41 pm - Stephen Browett: This could be the perfect thing for us to watch together as you have to wait for a week in between episodes üòù
10/11/2019, 8:49 pm - Solveig Andvig: Very true! When can you get up to speed on the last two episodes? üòÅ I looooove the books so I have high expectations for the series
10/11/2019, 11:20 pm - Stephen Browett: Probably tomorrow night ü§û
10/11/2019, 11:21 pm - Stephen Browett: Have you enjoyed the first two episodes? I've not read the books and don't really know what the series is about üòÖ
11/11/2019, 5:36 am - Solveig Andvig: Good! The new episodes are made available on Mondays for us so I will watch the second episode tonight üòÅ
11/11/2019, 5:42 am - Solveig Andvig: So the series is set in a world where northern lights and "dust" (some form of matter) hides the gate to parallel universes. The people who we follow have got spirit animals with them called daemons that follow them around like guardian angels. Lyra is a child with a secret destiny whom we follow in the series and now I'll stop to let you watch the epidodes without any spoilers!
11/11/2019, 5:43 am - Solveig Andvig: The books are extremely captivating. They made a film of the first book many years ago which no one really likes so they stopped the production. And now someone has taken up the concept again and made a series out of it ü§©
11/11/2019, 5:44 am - Solveig Andvig: I really liked the first episode but it lacked a good explanation of what the daemons are
11/11/2019, 7:35 pm - Stephen Browett: Maybe they're going to drip feed the information in throughout the series to keep an air of mystique about them?
11/11/2019, 7:35 pm - Stephen Browett: I'll be watching the first episode tonight fo sho
11/11/2019, 7:44 pm - Solveig Andvig: Perfect üòÅ I've just finished watching the second one so let me know when you're up to speed with the release
11/11/2019, 11:05 pm - Stephen Browett: OK, I have watched the first two episodes! üòÅ
11/11/2019, 11:30 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm really enjoying the world that's been created
11/11/2019, 11:30 pm - Stephen Browett: And the religious themes are super interesting
11/11/2019, 11:30 pm - Stephen Browett: Feels very galileo vs the church
12/11/2019, 6:31 am - Solveig Andvig: I'm as you liked it üòÅ Dagny asked me to explain the plot and it's difficult to make it sound engaging - I feel like it's one of those series you have to watch to like it. Like GoT; you have all these families fighting for the iron throne (wow now I really want to watch it!)
12/11/2019, 6:31 am - Solveig Andvig: Did you get the concept of the Daemon?
12/11/2019, 12:54 pm - Stephen Browett: Well I always though of GoT as just 'fighting and shagging but not always in that order' üòù
12/11/2019, 12:55 pm - Stephen Browett: I'm thinking of the daemons as spirit animals who the person has a life link with
12/11/2019, 1:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes üòÅüëçüèª
12/11/2019, 1:00 pm - Solveig Andvig: It takes its final form when they "grow up"
12/11/2019, 1:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think that's an accurate description but it's so much more because I don't particularly enjoy watching either üòÖ
12/11/2019, 7:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: Did you see the Cambridge analytica documentary on Netflix?
12/11/2019, 10:21 pm - Stephen Browett: I think I have! I can't remember what it's called though...
12/11/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: I remember that my takeaway message was "people are evil and computers are scary" üòù
12/11/2019, 10:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Be you watched it? What did you think?
12/11/2019, 10:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: I did and I'm sat with the same feeling üòÖ
12/11/2019, 10:41 pm - Stephen Browett: It's probably a bad time to show you this then üòù
https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953040/openai-text-generation-ai-gpt-2-full-model-release-1-5b-parameters
12/11/2019, 10:42 pm - Stephen Browett: I've been playing around with it this evening, it's quite interesting tbf
13/11/2019, 7:24 am - Solveig Andvig: You've tried generating text with it?
13/11/2019, 7:24 am - Solveig Andvig: I'd like to learn! ‚ò∫
13/11/2019, 11:00 am - Stephen Browett: Just using the linked website, I haven't tried the python bindings myself yet
13/11/2019, 11:00 am - Stephen Browett: That might be this evening's activity üòÅ
13/11/2019, 11:01 am - Stephen Browett: If I get it working I'll send the script over to you üëç
13/11/2019, 1:09 pm - Solveig Andvig: Thanks. üòÅ
13/11/2019, 2:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also I'll see if I can find time to try it out tonight
15/11/2019, 2:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Do you have Netflix?
15/11/2019, 2:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: I guess so since you watched unbelievable
15/11/2019, 2:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Have you seen the explained episode about the future of meat? Watching videos like this makes me want to behind a vegetarian üò£
15/11/2019, 5:55 pm - Stephen Browett: I don't know what "behind a vegetarian" means... Either something violent or sexual üòÇ
15/11/2019, 5:55 pm - Stephen Browett: I've not seen it though, not sure if it's a good idea now üòù
15/11/2019, 6:01 pm - Solveig Andvig: Hahaha don't judge until you've tried it!! üòÇ *Become
15/11/2019, 6:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: It was worth watching in terms of getting a balanced picture of why we should / shouldn't eat meat... I'm now wanting to become a vegetarian because of the way we overfarm them to get food but at the same time there are many benefits to it so maybe I should rather encourage only eating meat from free range animals / places where the animals have had a nice life. I end up crying when I see what we do with them to feed our appetite üòûüòû
16/11/2019, 2:48 pm - Stephen Browett: Tbf it has to happen in order to feed the number of people on the planet
16/11/2019, 2:49 pm - Stephen Browett: Although, I'm sure us westerners are much worse than most at eating too much meat which drives up demand
16/11/2019, 2:50 pm - Stephen Browett: I've been in favour of eating less meat for a while. Maybe having 3 vegetarian days a week or something
16/11/2019, 2:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: What happened to the all-meat guy I knew at uni??
16/11/2019, 2:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÅ
16/11/2019, 2:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also, another good documentary recommendation from Netflix: Ikaros
16/11/2019, 3:04 pm - Stephen Browett: Ooh, what's that one about?
16/11/2019, 3:10 pm - Solveig Andvig: I think it started out as an experiment; how can drugs increase my performance in sports / cycling and by how much? Then it ended up turning into an investigation of the corrupt anti doping sports in Russia. It's all tied in to the big scandal in 2015-2016 when Russia was banned from the Olympics and then allowed to re-enter. I really liked the pitch "well, no one can prove us wrong because we're the best at cheating so how could they?"
16/11/2019, 3:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Hahaha you can't beat that kind of internally consistent logic üòÇ
16/11/2019, 3:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Do they show how much improved a person can be through taking drugs?
16/11/2019, 3:32 pm - Stephen Browett: I'd be quite interested in seeing that
16/11/2019, 3:40 pm - Solveig Andvig: Sort of but but not numerically. I won't spoil things ‚ò∫
16/11/2019, 3:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: It was very captivating and made me a little bit paranoid üòÇ all the stories of not wanting to get on the wrong side with Russia's leader seem very true
16/11/2019, 5:04 pm - Solveig Andvig: Resorts world arena Birmingham - is this by the airport?
16/11/2019, 5:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Yeah, it's very close
Only about a 20 minute walk
16/11/2019, 5:34 pm - Stephen Browett: Is this where your conference is going to be?
16/11/2019, 5:36 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yeah, Ive been looking into it a bit more and apparently they run for 12 hours straight every day so I'm thinking I should stay close to the venue if I have the chance and come and visit you after ‚ò∫ I don't want to be rude and use your place only for sleeping and never talk for four days straight üòÇ
17/11/2019, 8:13 pm - Solveig Andvig: I just tried out the text-generating AI and the limitation I feel it has is that it assumes you want to write an article instead of a short response
17/11/2019, 8:14 pm - Solveig Andvig: what was your impression?
17/11/2019, 10:16 pm - Stephen Browett: My impression is that I've nearly got it working on my laptop but anaconda (my python package manager) needed to update before it could run and that was 24 hours ago... Still waiting... üòù
17/11/2019, 10:17 pm - Stephen Browett: I think that the model was trained in articles so it makes sense that it only knows how to write them. You could train it on article responses instead if you wanted to write a response
17/11/2019, 10:17 pm - Stephen Browett: It's totally do-able with the same model, it just needs retraining
17/11/2019, 10:17 pm - Stephen Browett: Which I could try as soon as anaconda sorts itself out...
17/11/2019, 10:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: You'll have to show me how when you get it working!
17/11/2019, 10:18 pm - Solveig Andvig: I want to try it out in work to see if I can train it to write better texts than the people working there üòÇ
17/11/2019, 10:19 pm - Solveig Andvig: I have loads of examples I can feed it but it depends on how you train it which I dont know?!
17/11/2019, 10:22 pm - Stephen Browett: You'll need 10,000s of training data (e.g. articles) to train it with
17/11/2019, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Woah ok I may not have that many
17/11/2019, 10:23 pm - Solveig Andvig: Not with the same starting point anyway
17/11/2019, 10:31 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha we'll need a Web scraper to gather the training data
17/11/2019, 10:32 pm - Stephen Browett: Any website with lots of "what you want to train the model to do" will be perfect
17/11/2019, 10:33 pm - Stephen Browett: Selenium is the tool designed for Web scraping
17/11/2019, 10:33 pm - Solveig Andvig: Is this the kind of thing you work with?
17/11/2019, 10:40 pm - Stephen Browett: I've not done much Web scraping before because it's a pain üòÖ
17/11/2019, 10:40 pm - Stephen Browett: But using models is something I do every week-ish
17/11/2019, 10:45 pm - Solveig Andvig: So clever üòå I hope you'll make time to help me learn a little more about this?
17/11/2019, 10:55 pm - Stephen Browett: Of course! Tbf once you've found out how one machine learning algo works then you'll see that they all basically work the same way
17/11/2019, 10:56 pm - Stephen Browett: And what's popular atm is to just use machine learning algos for everything
18/11/2019, 4:35 am - Solveig Andvig: That much I've noticed - which is also why I want to hit the band wagon and learn it üòÅ
18/11/2019, 3:15 pm - Stephen Browett: There's a really good online machine learning course by Andrew Ng. If you want to fully understand machine learning then take that course. It makes it super clear
18/11/2019, 4:54 pm - Solveig Andvig: Thanks! Will give it a go üòÅüí™üèª
18/11/2019, 4:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Have you seen Aberystwyth in the new season of the crown?
18/11/2019, 6:20 pm - Stephen Browett: I've not seen the old season of the crown üòÖ
18/11/2019, 6:21 pm - Stephen Browett: What we're they there for?
18/11/2019, 7:16 pm - Solveig Andvig: Prince Charles üòâ
18/11/2019, 7:53 pm - Solveig Andvig: Also the new episode of his dark materials is out!
19/11/2019, 2:56 pm - Solveig Andvig: <Media omitted>
19/11/2019, 5:38 pm - Stephen Browett: https://youtu.be/Dd7FixvoKBw
19/11/2019, 5:38 pm - Stephen Browett: Exactly how David described it üòù
19/11/2019, 5:39 pm - Stephen Browett: Also, the new episode of his dark materials was awesome!
19/11/2019, 5:41 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha that's me!
19/11/2019, 5:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: I love it and I'm glad you do too ‚ò∫
19/11/2019, 5:55 pm - Solveig Andvig: What in particular do you enjoy?
19/11/2019, 5:56 pm - Stephen Browett: In life? üòù
19/11/2019, 5:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: üòÇ
19/11/2019, 5:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes in life
19/11/2019, 5:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: And in the series
19/11/2019, 5:57 pm - Solveig Andvig: To be honest I don't know if anything has changed since uni but I suspect it has!
19/11/2019, 5:59 pm - Stephen Browett: Haha in life I enjoy good company
19/11/2019, 6:00 pm - Stephen Browett: In the series I enjoy the mystery surrounding the world and the characters that live in it
19/11/2019, 6:00 pm - Stephen Browett: Keeps you wondering what a person will do
19/11/2019, 6:02 pm - Solveig Andvig: Then you are depressed most of the time (?), because you don't get to see me very often ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
19/11/2019, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: üòÇ
19/11/2019, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Clearly
19/11/2019, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: Why do you think I'm so keen for this Finland holiday? üòù
19/11/2019, 6:23 pm - Stephen Browett: And for you to move to the UK
19/11/2019, 6:26 pm - Solveig Andvig: I'm not sure if you're laughing because I'm big headed or because I am right ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄ
19/11/2019, 6:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: Did I tell you I'm going to try and get a British passport? In awaiting some feedback from the embassy but it seems like I only need my dad's birthday certificate which shows he was a British citizen at birth and my own detials to get one
19/11/2019, 6:27 pm - Solveig Andvig: And after 01.01.2020 were also allowed to have dual citizenship in Norway
19/11/2019, 6:29 pm - Solveig Andvig: And then in about a year's time I'm probably going to move ‚ò∫ I've had some experience iny current job then and have had the chance to develop my data science skills
19/11/2019, 7:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Amazing! Come to brum üòù
19/11/2019, 7:29 pm - Stephen Browett: You're not allowed to have dual nationality currently?
19/11/2019, 7:29 pm - Stephen Browett: Is there a reason why not?
19/11/2019, 7:34 pm - Solveig Andvig: Haha maybe I should! You'll have to show me all the best places üòâ
19/11/2019, 7:35 pm - Solveig Andvig: Yes it's written in the law with some weird excuse üòÇ but they're removing it now
