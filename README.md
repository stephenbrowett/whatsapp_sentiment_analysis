# whatsapp_sentiment_analysis
Performing sentiment analysis on whatsapp conversations

The stats returned here are straight-forward but do provide fun insights into people's average sentiment towards you and most commonly used words.

This is intended as a bit of fun, please do not have any fallings-out over this script.

## Usage
Note: The requirements file is just a dump of all the packages in my current python environment (my apologies)

- Export a WhatsApp conversation to a .txt file in the `data` folder,
- Change the `filename` in `whatsAppSentimentAnalysis.py`,
- Open a python 3.x interpreter,
- Type `python3 whatsAppSentimentAnalysis.py` from command line **or** type `%run whatsAppSentimentAnalysis.py` from within a python interpreter
